But that isn't going to stop us serving you Tables Manners, even in special circumstances.\nI've moved the family out to an Airbnb to make sure Corona can't get her mitts on Lennie, Dr Alex is on the frontline, so it's a quiet (and clean) house for mum and means this is our first episode recorded remotely.\nVia the internet the wonderful, funny and gorgeous Grimmy joined us for a virtual dinner with mum and I. We talk bulk buying Hobnobs whilst in isolation, growing up in Manchester, eating luxuriously late now he isn't on breakfast radio and living on Freddos when he made it to London. Although gutted to not have him over and give him a kiss, cuddle and chicken soup it was a Zoom revelation and a welcome relief from a heavy week!

Although on a strict diet and fitness regime, Liam was a perfect guest enjoying what he could of the fantastic Beef and Mushroom pies we made him using a Waitrose & Partners recipe with their No. 1 range ingredients. We talk to him about dealing with fame, his terrible karaoke song choice, being a dad, finding love and happiness, tattoos and his favourite food being airport lounge calamari... Nothing was off the menu, even mother's filthy mouth, and we loved it! Liam Payne is served. X\n\n\nProduced by Alice Williams\n\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information."
