The sub-sea cable, which will bring in 20 times more network capacity than the previous cable built to serve the region, will then go on to Nigeria, Namibia and South Africa. \n \nIts proponents say it will speed up connections, drive down costs and create jobs.  \n \nOther big tech firms are also investing in infrastructure projects in a bid to improve connectivity on the continent - and to reach the 800 million people in Africa who have yet to experience the Internet.\n \nSo why was Togo chosen for the landing point?
