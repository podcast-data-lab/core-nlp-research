Today, the number of people questioning vaccines risks prolonging a pandemic that has already killed hundreds of thousands of Americans. How we got to this moment didn\u2019t start with the rollout of vaccines or in March 2020, or even with the election of Donald Trump. Our confidence in vaccines, often isn't even about vaccines. It\u2019s about trust. And that trust has been eroding for a long time. Doubt, a new series from Bloomberg\u2019s Prognosis podcast, looks at the forces that have been breaking down that trust. We'll trace the rise of vaccine skepticism in America to show how we got here \u2014 and where we\u2019re going. Doubt launches on March 23.

In 2017, the city found out the state was lowering the acceptable level of PFAS, a chemical made and used at the factory, in its drinking water. Scientific studies show there could be serious health consequences for people exposed to it. And now dozens of U.S. cities are discovering PFAS is in their water too. This week on Decrypted, Bloomberg's Tiffany Kary and Pia Gadkari tell the story of how a Minnesota lawyer first learned of PFAS contamination, and discuss documents revealed through lawsuits that suggest 3M knew of certain risks for decades and never disclosed them. 3M says those documents have been taken out of context and that the chemical isn't a danger to public health.\n Learn more about your ad-choices at https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com",
