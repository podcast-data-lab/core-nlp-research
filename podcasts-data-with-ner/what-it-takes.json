It showed a Ukrainian mother and her two children - lying dead on the street - killed by Russian mortar fire. The picture was taken by Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist Lynsey Addario. Addario has covered wars and humanitarian crises in 70 countries, including Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, and now Ukraine.  She has been kidnapped twice and has been badly injured on the job, but she is determined to open our eyes to the state of the world and the human toll of violence, no matter the risk. This episode originally posted in 2018, but is just as timely today.  Lynsey Addario is a lively storyteller who brings emotion and humor to every tale, whether she\u2019s describing growing up the child of hairdressers, the harrowing details of her kidnapping in Libya, or the heartbreaking work of documenting women who die in childbirth.</p>\n"

Tenley Albright was the very first American woman to win the Olympic gold medal in figure skating, and the first to win the World Championship. That was in 1956. It was a remarkable feat, made all the more so, because Tenley Albright was a polio survivor.  After those Olympics, she entered Harvard Medical School - one of only 5 women - and spent the next decades as a surgeon, a researcher, and a professor. At 86, she is still running a center she founded at MIT to devise creative solutions to public health issues.  She talks here about how her recovery from polio contributed to her success as a skater, and how the lessons of skating prepared her for a life in medicine.  She also tells some wonderful stories from the Winter Olympics, and shares her gentle insights about motivation and competition.",

In 1957, he wrote the lyrics for \"West Side Story,\" and for the next 60 years dominated the world of musical theater, and transformed it.  His songs managed to express the most complex and vital human emotions, and touched generations of theatergoers.  Stephen Sondheim was still writing and composing at 91, until Thanksgiving night, when he died suddenly, hours after dining with a group of friends.  The shows he leaves behind include \"West Side Story,\" \"Gypsy,\" \"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,\" \"Company,\" \"A Little Night Music,\" \"Sweeney Todd,\" \"Sunday in the Park with George,\" \"Into the Woods,\" and \"Assassins.\" In this episode, which originally posted in 2018, he pulls back the curtain on his life and work, giving fascinating insights into some of the greatest Broadway collaborations of all time, and into the process of writing a song for the stage.</p>\n"

It tells the story of two giants of American theater: Wilson, and his longtime collaborator, director Lloyd Richards. Together they brought many award-winning plays to Broadway - not only \"Ma Rainey,\" but also \"Fences,\" \"The Piano Lesson\" and others.  Wilson started out as a poet, but he turned to writing plays to bring stories of African-American life to the stage.  It was Lloyd Richards who recognized his talent and helped him shape it. Richards was already an icon in the theater world, for directing \"A Raisin in the Sun.\" In this episode you'll hear him tell the story behind that ground-breaking production, and  you'll  hear both these theater legends describe how they came to meet and have one of the most successful artistic collaborations in history.",

            "content:encoded": "<p>The United States seemed poised for a new day in 1963, when the March on Washington drew a quarter million people. And yet, throughout the intervening fifty-seven years, Martin Luther King Jr\u2019s dream has remained elusive. George Floyd\u2019s killing by police, two weeks ago, and the protests that have erupted in its wake, could not make that any clearer.  Over the next several weeks, we will feature some of the extraordinary voices from the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960\u2019s that are in the audio archive of the Academy of Achievement.  Today, we bring you our episode on Coretta Scott King. It originally posted in January of 2016. </p><p>As Mrs. King says, she wasn\u2019t just married to Martin Luther King Jr., she was married to the cause. Their partnership in life, in faith, and in the struggle for justice and human rights, changed the world. In this episode, Mrs. King describes her early aspirations in music, her courtship with Martin, and her courage in the face of violence. </p>\n"

In this episode, the Pulitzer Prize-winning, former Poet Laureate of the United States digs into the torment and uncertainty that has hounded her throughout her writing life.  She talks about how teaching poetry, which she feared would diminish her art, instead allowed it to flourish.   And she describes her obsessive desire to hear music in her ears, and language in her head.</p>\n<p>*The excerpt of Don Giovanni is from a Warner Classics recording, conducted by Carlo Maria Giulini, with Eberhard Wachter and Joan Sutherland.</p>\n"

It's hard to even remember the days (though not that long ago) when jobseekers opened the back of a newspaper to scan the help wanted ads.   Well, LinkedIn was the brainchild of Reid Hoffman, one of the Silicon Valley visionaries who recognized, back in the 1990's, the internet's potential for a new kind of social and professional networking.  In this episode he talks about how his background in philosophy led him to tech entrepreneurship.  And he provides some fascinating stories about the early days of the online revolution.</p>\n"

As she describes in this episode, other scientists did not believe that a young woman could survive alone in the bush, but Jane Goodall did more than survive. Her work revolutionized the field of primatology.  She was the first to document chimpanzees making and using tools, an activity that had been thought exclusively humans. Over the years she also witnessed cooperative hunting and altruism, but also brutality and even warfare among chimps. Her work, the longest continuous field study of any living creature, has given us deep insights into the evolution of our own species.  Since the 1980's, she has devoted herself single-mindedly to educating the public worldwide about the connections between animal welfare, the environment, and human progress.</p>\n"

            "content:encoded": "<p>In this episode, an intimate history of two pocket-sized devices that changed the world, and the two men who created them: Steve Jobs and Tony Fadell.  Jobs famously co-founded Apple.  In the late 90\u2019s, when the company was failing, he hired a young engineer and designer named Fadell, who created a little device that became known as the iPod.  It not only turned Apple\u2019s fortunes around, it transformed the music industry and the experience of listening. Fadell\u2019s next assignment was the iPhone, which changed the nature of communication itself.  After leaving Apple, Fadell went on to found Nest Labs, a company that has begun to alter the technology of the home. You\u2019ll hear Tony Fadell\u2019s fascinating personal story, told with all the passion and enthusiasm he brings to his game-changing inventions.  And you\u2019ll hear Steve Jobs, speaking as a young man (in 1982) about what it takes to innovate.</p>\n"

            "content:encoded": "<p>Andrew Young has worn many hats:  pastor, congressman, ambassador &amp; mayor, but his first role in public service was as Martin Luther King Jr\u2019s strategist and negotiator.  He was at King\u2019s side for many of the biggest battles of the civil rights movement, and he helped draft and secure the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  In this episode, Young shares his unique, personal stories about that turbulent period in our country\u2019s history - from the center of the storm.  He pays tribute to the women who were the often unacknowledged backbone of the civil rights struggle.  And he recounts his fascinating life story, from his youngest days growing up in New Orleans, where his father taught him to fight racism with brains and heart, to his spiritual revelation at the top of a mountain.</p>\n"
