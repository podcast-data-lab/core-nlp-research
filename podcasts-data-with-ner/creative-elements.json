They have a unique sound that's somewhere between folk, rock, and spooky western. Even more unique is their cult-like following that has supported them for the last 20 years. In this episode, we\u2019re talking about how Murder By Death has built such a loyal following. We talk about the early days on tour, how they accidentally got lumped in with the Emo movement, why they use Kickstarter, and how Gratitude has allowed them to keep this band going now, 20 years later.\nTranscript and show notes can be found here\n***\nLISTENER SUPPORT\nJoin our community on Facebook\nSupport this show through Buy Me A Coffee.\n***\nSPONSORS\nTry Podia and save 15% for life as a Creative Elements listener\nStart your free trial of SavvyCal and get your first month free using promo code ELEMENTS\n***\nABOUT JAY CLOUSE\nSubscribe to my weekly newsletter\nFind me on Twitter\nFind me on Instagram\nEnroll in my course on podcasting, Podcast Like The Pros\n***\nPODGLOMERATE NETWORK\nThis show is a part of the Podglomerate network, a company that produces, distributes, and monetizes podcasts.
