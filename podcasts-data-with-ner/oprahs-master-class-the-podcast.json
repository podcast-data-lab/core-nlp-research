Lynn discusses growing up in a close-knit community in her hometown of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and not really experiencing racism until high school. When she did, she says, it taught her to stand up for herself with the strength and conviction she'd learned from her mother. Lynn also shares how, as a teen, she found herself struggling to be perfect while dealing with her parents' divorce. After graduating from Howard University, Lynn headed to New York, where the entertainment business quickly taught her humility, and she realized how difficult it was to book decent acting jobs in a fiercely competitive industry. After relocating to Los Angeles and paying her dues, Lynn finally started landing bigger roles, including the legendary entertainer Josephine Baker in \"The Josephine Baker Story,\" for which she earned an Emmy. The TV movie led to her having her daughter, Grace, whom she had after falling in love with and marrying the project's director, Brian Gibson. However, her marriage to Gibson didn't last because, she says, she didn't have a spiritual base. That's when she returned to faith, which she credits with giving her the guidance and strength to raise her daughter alone after Gibson tragically died. Today, she stars as Lady Mae in OWN's hit series \"Greenleaf,\" a role she was initially hesitant to take but now relishes. Despite all her accomplishments, Lynn says she is constantly readjusting, always striving to find her inner truth.</p>\n",

After graduating from Howard University, Lynn headed to New York, where the entertainment business quickly taught her humility, and she realized how difficult it was to book decent acting jobs in a fiercely competitive industry. After relocating to Los Angeles and paying her dues, Lynn finally started landing bigger roles, including the legendary entertainer Josephine Baker in \"The Josephine Baker Story,\" for which she earned an Emmy. The TV movie led to her having her daughter, Grace, whom she had after falling in love with and marrying the project's director, Brian Gibson. However, her marriage to Gibson didn't last because, she says, she didn't have a spiritual base. That's when she returned to faith, which she credits with giving her the guidance and strength to raise her daughter alone after Gibson tragically died. Today, she stars as Lady Mae in OWN's hit series \"Greenleaf,\" a role she was initially hesitant to take but now relishes. Despite all her accomplishments, Lynn says she is constantly readjusting, always striving to find her inner truth."

Dwayne shares deeply personal stories about his life, from his humble beginnings all the way through his blockbuster movie career. For years, Dwayne says, he and his parents lived paycheck to paycheck, moving to a different city every time his dad, a professional wrestler in the '80s, got a new gig. As a high school student, Dwayne started getting into trouble. He was arrested for everything from fighting and stealing to forging checks. Nevertheless, Dwayne says, he was able to start changing his life for the better when he was 16 years old. After playing football for four years at the University of Miami, Dwayne was passed over by the NFL. Although he played for the Canadian Football League for a short time, he was ultimately cut from his team, the Calgary Stampeders. At 23, Dwayne found himself living in his parents' small apartment, battling depression. How he was able to leave his parents' home and eventually become one of the biggest names in Hollywood is a story that is as amazing as it is inspirational. To date, Dwayne's films, such as \"Jumanji,\" \"San Andreas\" and the \"Fast and Furious\" franchise, have earned a combined box office totaling more than $3 billion.
