    "description": "<p>There\u2019s no denying it - we have to tackle the climate emergency. Burning fossil fuels to get energy has to end. It's doable but it's going to take solutions in every industry, at every scale, in every nation in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/podcast/no-denying-it\">No Denying It</a></strong>, the UN climate action podcast, brings you the voices of young climate changemakers from across our warming planet. These activists, engineers, and entrepreneurs show us how we can make big changes - in our homes, our jobs, where we vote and where we pray, and with our family and friends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because we all have to start somewhere - but the important thing is to get started. There\u2019s no denying it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can find <strong><a href=\"http://news.un.org/en/podcast/no-denying-it\">No Denying It</a></strong>, the UN climate action podcast, wherever you get your podcasts.</p>",
