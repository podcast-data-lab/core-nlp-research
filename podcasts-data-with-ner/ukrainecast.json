We speak to Maxim, a street artist from Nova Kakhovka in the Russian-controlled region of Kherson, who\u2019s been graffitiing enemy tanks.\n\nAfter President Biden warned that Russia has the capability to launch cyber attacks in response to sanctions, the Oxford Internet Institute\u2019s Mariarosaria Taddeo joins Gabriel, Vitaly and Victoria to explain why the digital risk goes beyond Ukraine.\n\nWe also catch up with Anna to hear how she and her family are feeling after fleeing Kharkiv and whether they might make it to Canada.\n\nThis episode of Ukrainecast was made by Daniel Wittenberg with Phil Marzouk, Chris Flynn and Michele Theil.
