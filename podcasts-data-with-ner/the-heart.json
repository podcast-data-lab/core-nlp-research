At the workshop, the facilitators spent 45 minutes going into extreme detail of the complexities of the female system of sexual arousal. Then they spent 15 minutes on the male system. The facilitator insinuated that it was very simple \u2013 touch the dick, make him come. During the question and answer period the male bodied people in the room protested, insisting that the male anatomy is just as mysterious and complicated as the female anatomy. This is when Kaitlin learned about the P-spot \u2013 the prostate orgasm.<br><br>\nOne Saturday night, Kaitlin ventured onto St. Laurent Boulevard in Montreal and asked strangers if they had ever had their P-spots touched.

After the lake and 6 weeks of talking on the phone every day, Sarah amtraked to the big city and settled in to the apartment they signed a year\u2019s lease for. They hadn\u2019t even slept together yet. But they were crazy about each other. They wanted more. They wanted it all.\nThe great question: is chemistry enough to get through the yet unknown interpersonal frictions and differences?\nThis episode of The Heart is secretly called 9-1-1 Vox Pop, produced at the last minute with the help of some very talented individuals.\n\nFirst, the music. The music was originally composed for the episode by the incredible Matthew Daher. He just released an EP called Dwelling Lightheartedly In the Futility of Everything.

We meet this threshold with no knowledge of what will happen, how we or the world will react.</p>\n\n<p>Once the rules of the game change, once we do something that we\u2019ve never done before, the question of how to navigate the new world is what comes next. What do we do after the first kiss? Will it give way to the first holding of hands, the first public display of affection, the first sex, the first week sleeping in someone else\u2019s bed every night? Or will it be the first, but also \u2014 the last?</p>\n\n<p>This is a story featuring Drew Denny, a singer, songwriter, filmmaker and artist.
