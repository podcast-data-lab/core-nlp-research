This is a story about the risks of buying unknown substances on the internet -- where the spread of information transcends borders -- and how toxic beauty standards and body image issues have fueled a demand for a pill that can kill you. Together, actress Elle Fanning and journalist Jessica Wapner trace the history of DNP and reckon with the question of why. Why, despite the perils, have so many turned to DNP and what does it say about the health of our society?",

This series explores how a single click can change a life forever.

Together, actress Elle Fanning and journalist Jessica Wapner, trace the history of DNP and reckon with the question of why. Through the story of DNP and its victims, we encounter issues of body image and mental health as the series unravels the chain of events that could lead to one fatal decision.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
