    "description": "We Share The Same Sky is an intimate portrait of family history that tells the stories of two young women\u2014Hana as a refugee who remains one step ahead of the Nazis at every turn, and Rachael, her granddaughter, on a search to retrace her grandmother\u2019s history. Presented by USC Shoah Foundation, this seven-part narrative series explores how the retelling of family stories becomes history itself and how acts of kindness during war can echo across generations.
