            "content:encoded": "<p>In this love poem, Matthew Olzmann writes about his wife \u2014 the poet Vievee Francis whose poem for Matthew was featured in the previous episode \u2014 and the reasons why their marriage <i>might</i> work: her courage, her tenacity, her quirks, her multiplicities. He recounts instances of her generosity and lands on a story of how, when she was down to her \u201clast damn dime,\u201d she  still bought a bottle of Mountain Dew for him, because she knew he loved it. This is a cinematic and musical poem, making exquisite use of a particular object: a bottle of soda, holding fizz in it, and symbolizing more love than it could contain.</p><p><strong>Matthew Olzmann </strong> was born in Detroit, Michigan. He received a BA from the University of Michigan\u2013Dearborn and an MFA from Warren Wilson College. He is the author of<a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/10066/9781938584275\"> <i>Contradictions in the Design</i></a> and<a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/10066/9781882295982\"> <i>Mezzanines</i></a>, winner of the 2011 Kundiman Poetry Prize. Olzmann has received fellowships from the Kresge Arts Foundation and Kundiman, among others. He teaches at Warren Wilson College and lives in North Carolina with his wife, the poet Vievee Francis.</p><p>Find the transcript for this show at <a href=\"https://onbeing.org/programs/matthew-olzmann-mountain-dew-commercial-disguised-as-a-love-poem/#transcript\">onbeing.org</a>.</p>\n"

The poem imagines a bridge between these two places and cultures, and arrives, in the second stanza, at the image of a \u201cliving root bridge.\u201dIt is in this image that the poem anchors itself: a bridge that is part of the earth, a bridge that lives, that is not torn, but alive and growing. This metaphor speaks to what is possible in a life, and helps Jónína Kirton thrive in the tension she thought would tear her.</p><p><strong>Jónína Kirton </strong>is a Red River Métis/Icelandic poet and a graduate of the Simon Fraser University\u2019s Writer\u2019s Studio where she is currently their BIPOC Auntie supporting and mentoring BIPOC students. In 2016, she received the City of Vancouver\u2019s Mayor\u2019s Arts Award for an Emerging Artist in the Literary Arts category.

What are the circumstances and stories behind these pet names?</i></p><p>In <a href=\"https://onbeing.org/poetry/bone-of-my-bone-and-flesh-of-my-flesh\">this poem</a>, a woman considers the pet names to give her female partner; \u201cMy beloved\u201d isn\u2019t very convenient when you\u2019re dropping off dry cleaning. And what word to use when speaking of how she annoys you? Written in the time before same-sex marriage was legalized in the U.S., the humor of this poem highlights how policy can steal language from the everyday.</p><p><strong>Ellen Bass</strong> is chancellor of the Academy of American Poets and teaches at Pacific University.
