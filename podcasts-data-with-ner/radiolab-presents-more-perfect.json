Think of these episodes as the audio liner notes.</em></p>\r\n<p>On first read the 16th and 22nd Amendments are at best sleepers and at worst, stinkers. In a list of Constitutional hits like the right to free speech, the right to bear arms, and birthright citizenship, the amendments covering taxes and term limits tend to fall by the wayside. But in Episode 6 of More Perfect's third season we take these forgotten gems and make them shine.</p>\r\n<p>The 16th Amendment sets up the income tax, sinking dread into the hearts of millions of Americans every April. But if the income tax is so hated, why did we vote to put it in the Constitution? And why do so many people willingly pay? In this episode we take on those questions and contemplate whether the 16th amendment might be less about money or law, than is about deciding what it means to belong.</p>\r\n<p>Next we move on to the 22nd Amendment and presidential term limits.

We're taking on these 27 amendments both in song and in story. This episode is best listened to alongside </em><a href=\"https://project.wnyc.org/themostperfectalbum/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>27: The Most Perfect Album</em></a><em>, an entire album (an ALBUM!) and digital experience of original music and art inspired by the 27 Amendments. Think of these episodes as the audio liner notes.</em></p>\n<p>Amendments 13, 14, and 15 are collectively known as the Reconstruction Amendments: they were passed as instructions to rebuild the country after Civil War. They addressed slavery, citizenship, equality and voting rights for black people. This week, the <em>More Perfect </em>team explores the legacy of the amendments beyond the Civil War \u2014 the ways the promises of these amendments changed the country and the ways they've fallen short.</p>\n<p>First, <em>More Perfect </em>Executive Producer Suzie Lechtenberg and Legal Editor Elie Mystal explore the loophole in the 13th Amendment's slavery ban that's being used in a strange context: college football. We share songs about the 13th Amendment from <a href=\"https://project.wnyc.org/themostperfectalbum/#amendment-13\">Kash Doll and Bette Smith</a>. Then, producer Julia Longoria shares a conversation with her roommate Alia Almeida exploring their relationship to the amendments.</p>\n<p>Inspired by the 14th's Amendment's grant of equal protection and citizenship rights, <a href=\"https://project.wnyc.org/themostperfectalbum/#amendment-14\">Sarah Kay's poem</a> tells the story of her grandmother, a U.S. citizen who was interned during World War II in a Japanese American Internment camp. Despite the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause, the Supreme Court upheld the internment of U.S. citizens based solely on their Japanese heritage in a case called <em><a href=\"https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/american-pendulum-fred/\" target=\"_blank\">Korematsu v. United States</a></em>. In 2018, the Supreme Court said <em>Korematsu</em> was \"wrong the day it was decided.\" The Court went on to uphold President Trump's controversial travel ban in <em>Trump v. Hawaii</em>. \"Korematsu has nothing to do with this case,\" wrote the majority. In a dissenting opinion, Justice Sotomayor accused the majority of \"redeploying the same dangerous logic underlying <em>Korematsu\"</em> when they upheld the ban.</p>\n<p>Finally, hear songs inspired by the 15th Amendment by <a href=\"https://project.wnyc.org/themostperfectalbum/#amendment-15\">Aisha Burns and </a><a href=\"https://project.wnyc.org/themostperfectalbum/#amendment-15\">Nnamidi Ogbonnaya</a>.<a href=\"https://project.wnyc.org/themostperfectalbum/#amendment-15\"></a></p>"

But \u201cthe efficiency gap\u201d could be it. The mathematical formula measures how many votes Democrats and Republicans waste in elections \u2014 if either side is way outside the norm, there may be some foul play at hand. According to Loyola law professor Justin Levitt, both the case and the formula arrive at a critical time: \u201cAfter the census in 2020, all sorts of different bodies will redraw all sorts of different lines and this case will help decide how and where.\u201d</p>\r\n<p>The key voices:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://mduchin.math.tufts.edu/\">Moon Duchin</a>, Associate Professor at Tufts University</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.lls.edu/faculty/facultylistl-r/levittjustin/\">Justin Levitt</a>, Professor of Law at Loyola Law School, Los Angeles</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The key cases:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2004: <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2003/02-1580\"><em>Vieth v.

The plaintiff was Abigail Fisher, a white woman, who said she was rejected from the University of Texas because the university unfairly considered race as one of many factors when evaluating applicants. And while Fisher\u2019s claims were the focus of the case, the story behind how she ended up in front of the Supreme Court is a lot more complicated.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEdward Blum is the director of the Project on Fair Representation\n\r\n(AEI)\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn this episode, we visit Edward Blum, a 64-year-old \u201clegal entrepreneur\u201d and former stockbroker who has become something of a Supreme Court matchmaker \u2014 He takes an issue, finds the perfect plaintiff, matches them with lawyers, and works his way to the highest court in the land. He\u2019s had remarkable success, with 6 cases heard before the Supreme Court, including that of Abigail Fisher. We also head to Houston, Texas, where in 1998, an unusual 911 call led to one of the most important LGBTQ rights decisions in the Supreme Court\u2019s history.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Lawrence (L) and Tyron Garner (R) at the 2004 Pride Parade in Houston\n\r\n(J.D.
