We spoke to Leone Ross about her sensuous, absorbing new novel, This One Sky Day, which is set in the fictional Carribean archipelago of Popisho, where everyone is born with a certain magical gift, or cors. It's a story about many things, but mainly of two lovers trying to find their way back to one another over the course of a single day while the world shifts around them. We spoke to Leone about the subversive potential of magical realism, it's political power, and why some people are still so snobby about it.

Helping us consider these questions is our guest, the author Mary Gaitskill, who joined us to talk about her masterful long essay Lost Cat, which has just been published in the UK for the first time. It\u2019s the story of her lost cat, Gattino, and also a clear-eyed and heartbreaking meditation on who we are allowed to love, how different kinds of suffering are connected, and the hope and pain that love can bring. Inspired by Gattino and Mary, the theme of today\u2019s show is \u2018Complicated Love\u2019, and we\u2019ll be looking at its joys and perils in books from Romeo and Juliet to Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit. Listen in for our interview with Mary Gaitskill, thoughts about the whys and wherefores of how love gets complicated in literature, and all our usual recommendations. \n\nRecommendations on the theme, Complicated Love:\nOctavia: The Pisces by Melissa Broder https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/the-pisces-9781408890981/\nCarrie: Middlemarch by George Eliot https://www.gutenberg.org/files/145/145-h/145-h.htm\n\nGeneral Recommendations:\nOctavia: Hot Milk by Deborah Levy https://www.penguin.co.uk/articles/2016/hot-milk-by-deborah-levy/\nMary: Snow by Orhan Pamuk https://www.abebooks.co.uk/book-search/title/snow/author/orhan-pamuk/\nCarrie: Beloved by Toni Morrison https://bookshop.org/books/beloved/9781400033416\n\nEmail us: litfriction@gmail.com \nTweet us & find us on Instagram: @litfriction",

Helping us consider these questions is our guest, the author Mary Gaitskill, who joined us to talk about her masterful long essay Lost Cat, which has just been published in the UK for the first time. It\u2019s the story of her lost cat, Gattino, and also a clear-eyed and heartbreaking meditation on who we are allowed to love, how different kinds of suffering are connected, and the hope and pain that love can bring. Inspired by Gattino and Mary, the theme of today\u2019s show is \u2018Complicated Love\u2019, and we\u2019ll be looking at its joys and perils in books from Romeo and Juliet to Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit. Listen in for our interview with Mary Gaitskill, thoughts about the whys and wherefores of how love gets complicated in literature, and all our usual recommendations. \n\nRecommendations on the theme, Complicated Love:\nOctavia: The Pisces by Melissa Broder https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/the-pisces-9781408890981/\nCarrie: Middlemarch by George Eliot https://www.gutenberg.org/files/145/145-h/145-h.htm\n\nGeneral Recommendations:\nOctavia: Hot Milk by Deborah Levy https://www.penguin.co.uk/articles/2016/hot-milk-by-deborah-levy/\nMary: Snow by Orhan Pamuk https://www.abebooks.co.uk/book-search/title/snow/author/orhan-pamuk/\nCarrie: Beloved by Toni Morrison https://bookshop.org/books/beloved/9781400033416\n\nEmail us: litfriction@gmail.com \nTweet us & find us on Instagram: @litfriction",

This month\u2019s show is dedicated to the building blocks of all books: words. Joining us is the author Eley Williams, whose first novel The Liar\u2019s Dictionary is both about words and delights in them. In the novel, Peter Winceworth, a disgruntled employee of Swansby\u2019s New Encyclopedic Dictionary at the turn of the century, begins inserting his own invented words into the first edition. In the present day, intern Mallory is tasked with rooting out his mischievous insertions. We spoke to Eley about lots of things including our favourite words and reading the dictionary like a novel, so kick back and join us for an hour of lexical wonder and appreciation. \n\nRecommendations on the theme, The Joy of Words: \nOctavia: A Lover\u2019s Discourse: Fragments by Roland Barthes \nhttps://monoskop.org/images/f/f7/Roland_Barthes_Roland_a_lover_s_discourse_1978.pdf\nCarrie: A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess \nhttps://www.anthonyburgess.org/a-clockwork-orange/\n\nGeneral Recommendations:\nOctavia: Blueberries by Ellena Savage \nhttps://scribepublications.co.uk/books-authors/books/blueberries\nEley: and what if we are all allowed to disappear by Tania Hershman \nhttps://www.guillemotpress.co.uk/poetry/tania-hershman\nCarrie: The Fifth Season by N K Jemisin \nhttps://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/n-k-jemisin/the-fifth-season/9780316229296/\n\nEmail us: litfriction@gmail.com \nTweet us & find us on Instagram: @litfriction",

It's also a beautiful meditation on aesthetics and beauty and who is allowed access to them. Listen in for all the usual recommendations, and a chance to find out if you're an Arcadian or a Utopian.

                "summary": "This month, we're going behind closed doors with Carmen Maria Machado, who dialled in from the States to talk to us. Her innovative memoir, In The Dream House, is about her experience of domestic abuse, something that is so often hidden from view, and even more so when it happens in a queer relationship. What does it mean to write into archival silence? How do we tell the most difficult stories? As usual, our theme is inspired by our guest, so join us as we talk about literature that looks at what happens behind closed doors, both in the literal sense - domestic spaces that are not what they seem, or hold secrets - but also those books that show us narratives that are usually left out of literature and culture.

We want to offer a little escapism, but we also want, maybe even need to talk about what's going on right now. So we're going to talk about literature in quarantine, which also means talking about not being able to read at all. We hope you're all doing ok, and we remain at your service through whatever's on the horizon, and as always, thank you for listening.\n\nThis episode is sponsored by Picador https://www.panmacmillan.com/picador @picadorbooks",

Gill. Our guest is Irish novelist Eimear McBride, who has come back on the show to talk about her third novel Strange Hotel, which follows an unnamed protagonist as she moves from hotel room to hotel room around the world, trying to forget her past, and the powerful allure of an untethered life.

Have you ever recommended a book and then realised you can\u2019t remember what happens in it? Have you ever picked up a book and got halfway through before realising you've read it before? (One of us may have some confessions to make). Minisode Six is about re-reading - how we do it, if we do it, why we do it. We also have some announcements: we're about to take a summer break but we'll be back in 2 weeks with an author special featuring Ocean Vuong, and then we\u2019ll be resting our voices til September and working on building our website and putting together a great autumn programme. But don\u2019t worry! We\u2019ll be re-running old shows from our archive in the meantime.",

Instead, we\u2019ll be talking about all the other wonderful books that have taken us on the road and, usually, on a journey of discovery too. Our guest is writer Damian Le Bas, whose fascinating debut The Stopping Places is a journey through Gypsy Britain, in which he visits the places scattered across the country where his Gypsy family and ancestors made their temporary homes. So listen in for a show dedicated to the tradition of books that roam, road novels and their intrepid travelling protagonists, and other books that use journeys as their narrative frame, plus all the usual recommendations. Ideal listening for those of you that are on the move!",

We spoke to author Pajtim Statovci about his brilliant first novel, My Cat Yugoslavia, which was originally published in Finnish in 2014. It tells the story of a young gay refugee from the Balkans, whose search for meaning in the midst of loneliness leads him to purchase a boa constrictor, in spite of his acute fear of snakes, and to befriend a talking cat he meets in a Helsinki gay bar.",

            "contentSnippet": "Ever wonder if you're with the flock, or against it? British author and psychiatric doctor Joanna Cannon\u2019s debut novel The Trouble with Goats and Sheep (a Sunday Times bestseller) explores how we treat - or more often mistreat - people who don't quite fit in. It tells the story of two young girls who decide to investigate a housewife\u2019s disappearance from their tight-knit estate during the heat wave of 1976, and the unlikely truth they uncover. In honour of rebels and misfits everywhere, our theme this month is BLACK SHEEP. Join us as we interview Joanna, and discuss our favourite literary characters who stand on the margins - from Holden Caufield to Jane Eyre to Oscar Wao and more."
