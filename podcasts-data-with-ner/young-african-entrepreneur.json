Growing up, she wanted to be a doctor, but there was no math teacher in her village, which halted her future medical career. She studied at University of Fort Hare, a historically important black university. Encouraged by a professor, Dr. Lulu completed her masters in urban planning at the University of Natal, a predominantly white higher education institution where she was one of a handful of black students. She qualified as the first black town and regional planner \u2013 a remarkable achievement in apartheid South Africa. In the late 1980s, Dr. Lulu left for London for further graduate studies; she graduated from the London School of Economics with a masters in social policy & planning and the University College London with a PhD. With the election of Nelson Mandela in 1994, South Africa\u2019s apartheid regime was no more. Dr. Lulu joined the government as a director in the national department of public works. For the next ten years, she worked in development, consulting, and research, notably for the World Bank. In the early 2000s, Dr. Lulu parlayed her diverse professional experiences into business. She set up Lereko Investments with partners and quickly established herself as a power player in South Africa\u2019s corporate world.

            "contentSnippet": "Florida Uzoaru is the founder/CEO of Slide Safe, Nigeria\u2019s first STI self-testing kit delivery service. You can connect with her @dasexlady on Facebook and @slidesafeng on Twitter and Instagram. You can also find her on LinkedIn @Florida Uzoaru. Despite coming from a commercially minded Nigerian family, Florida grew up hating sales. For her, it was like begging. In her 20s, she entered the public health profession and became passionate about promoting safe sex in Nigeria. While Nigeria has one of the world\u2019 highest rates of HIV infection, only 10% of the population actually gets tested. Frustrated with the approach of NGOs, which failed to tackle the problem on the ground, she came up with the idea for Slide Safe \u2013an online service that delivers self-testing kits for HIV, hepatitis B, and other sexually transmitted infections as well as contraceptives. But, she was reluctant to publicly promote her business. She thought she could be a behind-the-scene founder. After all, she grew up hating sales. But, she finally told herself to \u201cstop running away\u201d from taking on a public role as founder of Slide Safe. Since then, Florida has become a fierce and vocal advocate of her business and adopting safe sex practices in Nigeria. Florida speaks candidly about her many pivots during her entrepreneurial journey as well as the difficulties she faced while refining the messaging of Slide Safe. (Its original name was Sex in a Box but that didn\u2019t go down well in conservative Nigeria.) She also talks about her experiences at the CC Hub and Tony Elumelu accelerator programs, the nuanced challenges of being a female entrepreneur, and why subscription services just don\u2019t work in Nigeria. Without further do, here\u2019s my conversation with Florida Uzoaru."

You can connect with him @Rockson2 and @mPharmaHealth on Twitter. MPharma is a digital healthcare company that is helping Africans access high-quality medications. When Greg left for the US to study at university, he wanted to be a doctor. But he quickly realized that he could have a greater impact by studying the business of healthcare on the continent. How often have you gone to a pharmacy which didn\u2019t have the drug that you needed? It\u2019s a problem that is common across the continent and has a devastating impact on Africans, especially those who have illnesses requiring regular treatment, like diabetes, cancer or heart disease. Greg wanted to tackle this problem. Hence, mPharma was born. He built an e-prescription platform that would allow seamless communication between doctors and pharmacies so that patients could get their drugs on time. But he realized that this was the tip of the iceberg. The bigger issue was that Africans can\u2019t afford drugs due to high costs. High quality drugs are expensive. What is mPharma bought the drugs, using its purchasing power to negotiate better prices from the pharmaceutical manufacturers? Partnering pharmacies could then buy the drugs on consignment, drastically lowering costs for consumers. Greg has taken it a step further, developing a product that allows consumers to buy drugs in installments. I love mPharma, which is incredibly innovative and driving real change in Africa\u2019s healthcare sector. Without further ado, here\u2019s my conversation with Greg Rockson.</p>\n",

Since the podcast launched, I\u2019ve interviewed a dozen amazing entrepreneurs with thriving businesses in Africa. They\u2019ve candidly shared advice, tips, and insights into how they persevere in the face of challenges. What\u2019s remarkable is that all of these entrepreneurs share a common mindset that has been critical to their success. As renowned entrepreneur Tony Robbins said, success as an entrepreneur is 20% skills and 80% psychology, or mindset. You have to develop the right psychology to handle the emotional rollercoaster of being an African entrepreneur. Being an entrepreneur anywhere is tough, but I\u2019d argue that being an entrepreneur in Africa is even more difficult. When I looked through my notes from past episodes, it was incredible to see the similarities of these entrepreneurs. Whatever the subject was \u2013 whether it be networking, finding an idea for your business, or dealing with inevitable failure \u2013 these entrepreneurs had similar opinions and approaches.

You can connect with him @wizaj on Twitter and via his website http://wiza.jalaka.si. By 16, Wiza had already founded his company, Mwtunes, an online music distribution platform that was ahead of its time in his home country of Malawi. At university in Nairobi, he and his cofounder set up Djuaji, Research, a market research company that paid survey participants via mobile money. It held a lot of promise. It was innovative, cost effective, and accurate. Early on, Djuaji raised seed capital from Savannah Fund and participated in its elite accelerator program. It all seemed to be going well. Until it wasn\u2019t. Wiza and his cofounder were running out of cash and they weren\u2019t close to figuring out how to make the business viable. He made a tough choice: He resigned and returned to Malawi. Shortly thereafter, he spoke with Sam Gikandi, founder of Africa is Talking, an API developer, who offered him a job to set up the Malawi office. Wiza had some reservations about working for someone else, but he quickly overcame those doubts and has never looked back. Africa is Talking recently raised $8.6mn for its expansion into new markets, including Cote d\u2019Ivoire, which Wiza will be spearheading. I thoroughly enjoyed my conversation with Wiza. He\u2019s extremely eloquent and a fount of knowledge about the emotional roller coaster of being a young African tech entrepreneur. Without further ado, here\u2019s my conversation with Wiza Jalakasi.</p>\n",
