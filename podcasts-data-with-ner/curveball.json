When he was deciding whether or not to take a leadership role at the ABC, Gaven realised he was in a pretty tough spot: he\u2019d become an expert in everything but how a great leader should operate. \nIn part 1 of this candid interview, Gaven gives you a rare glimpse into the defining moments in his career: traumatic experiences, reporting from far-flung places, and the delayed effects of this on his mental health.   \n+++ \nCurveball is a production of Deadset Studios. Leaders reveal their darkest moments and share tips on how the deal with those things you just can\u2019t see coming.  \nKeep up to date with Curveball by following @_deadsetstudios on Twitter and @deadsetstudios on instagram.  \nWant more from your leadership journey?

Sometimes, despite your best intentions, things don\u2019t just work out and it\u2019s better to give in to the signs. \nSo many leaders on Curveball have, at some point, found themselves in a tricky situation. And yes,  sometimes they\u2019ve pulled through. \nBut what about those times you just can\u2019t pull a rabbit out of a hat? How do you know when it\u2019s time to call time on your business or your dream? \nRunning any company involves the fine art of juggling when to push beyond the limits, and when to call it quits. Top leaders share their stories of knowing when to fold them... just like As Kenny Rogers sang! \n+++ \nCurveball is a production of Deadset Studios. Keep up to date with Curveball by following @_deadsetstudios on Twitter and @deadsetstudios on instagram.  \nWant more from your leadership journey? Sign up to Curveball\u2019s LinkedIn newsletter - it contains more wisdom than the old dude from the Karate Kid! \nFind out more about the show by visiting www.curveballshow.com   \nThis episode was produced by Liam Riordan. The executive producers are Rachel Fountain and Kellie Riordan. \nWe acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the land on which this show was made. \nLearn more about your ad choices.

Annnndddd Curveball also now has a LinkedIn newsletter so please sign up for useful tips and strategies the best in the biz use so you too can thrive like a MOFO in 2021!
