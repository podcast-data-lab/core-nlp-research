And now, GOP candidates are tapping into the \u201cBig Lie,\u201d campaigning for office on the promise to change how future elections are run. \n\nWe zero in on Michigan, a key swing state where Republicans are aiming to shape the future of elections. Reporter Byard Duncan talks with the Antrim County clerk, who was flooded with ugly calls and threats after her office accidentally assigned votes meant for Donald Trump to Joe Biden. While the error was quickly fixed, many in the GOP, including Trump, have used the county to sow doubt about the entire election\u2019s results. Duncan reports on the race for secretary of state, Michigan\u2019s top election official, and how the leading GOP candidate has repeatedly referenced Antrim County to question the integrity of elections. The Trump-endorsed candidate has outraised her Republican opponents by at least tenfold. \n\nThere was no meaningful election fraud in Michigan in 2020. But some local election officials who voted to certify the election have paid a price. Reporter Trey Bundy tells the story of Wayne County official Monica Palmer, a Republican who was kicked off the local canvassing board after certifying the election. And she\u2019s just one of many: Republicans have now placed new election officials on boards in eight of Michigan\u2019s largest counties. At least half of them have cast doubt on the integrity of the 2020 election.\n\nFinally, looking to the future, Republicans in Michigan are making it harder to vote. Since the 2020 election, the Michigan Senate, led by Republicans, has introduced nearly 40 bills to change its election laws, all of which propose new barriers to voting. Guest host Shereen Marisol Meraji talks with Branden Snyder, co-executive director of Detroit Action, a local activist group that organizes working-class Detroiters, about how his group is mobilizing against efforts to undermine the vote.\n\n\nSupport Reveal\u2019s journalism at <a href=\"https://checkout.fundjournalism.org/memberform?org_id=cir&amp;amount=15&amp;installmentPeriod=monthly&amp;utm_source=reveal-podcast&amp;utm_medium=partner-website&amp;utm_campaign=membership_2022_podcastdescription&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_term=&amp;campaign=7015d000001wAmaAAE\" target=\"_blank\">Revealnews.org/donatenow</a> \nSubscribe to our weekly newsletter to get the scoop on new episodes at <a href=\"https://revealnews.org/newsletter/?utm_source=reveal-podcast&amp;utm_medium=partner-website&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_2022_podcastdescription&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_term=&amp;campaign=\" target=\"_blank\">Revealnews.org/newsletter</a>\nConnect with us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reveal\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ThisIsReveal\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/revealnews/\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>\n\r\n      ",

It\u2019s an organization with radical roots, promising to do whatever it takes to deliver life-saving care to people in need. But now, it\u2019s struggling to address institutional racism.\n\nThe organization, also known by its French acronym MSF, has about 63,000 people working in 88 countries.

Ukrainians have been living through \u201cthe long war\u201d of a threatened \u2013 and brutally real \u2013 Russian invasion for decades. We hear from 60-year-old Irina Dovgan, who refused to leave her home, with its blooming garden and many pets, when separatist fighters took over her region in 2014. She became an international symbol of the invasion after Russian-backed forces arrested, abused and publicly humiliated her. Now, Dovgan is living through a second invasion.  \n\nReporting from Ukraine, Coda Story\u2019s Glenn Kates explains what it\u2019s been like to live in Kyiv as Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened to invade. While many Ukrainians speak Russian and have deep ties to the country, Kates talks to Kyiv residents about how Putin\u2019s threats of invasion and violence have shifted their sense of identity. As the invasion approaches, each person has to weigh the nearly impossible question of what they will do to survive.  \n\nTo understand what it\u2019s like to be a journalist in Ukraine and Russia right now, host Ike Sriskandarajah speaks with propaganda expert Peter Pomerantsev. Born in Ukraine and now a fellow at Johns Hopkins University and contributing editor at Coda Story, Pomerantsev describes how challenging Putin\u2019s official version of events can land journalists in prison. Under a new law, even calling the invasion an \u201cinvasion\u201d could lead to a 15-year prison sentence. \n\nFinally, Reveal\u2019s Elizabeth Shogren takes listeners back to a time when Russia was charting a different course. In 1989, Shogren was a Moscow-based reporter covering the Soviet Union\u2019s first freely elected legislature. She talks with Russian reporter Sergey Parkhomenko about how, since Putin\u2019s election in 2000, the Russian president has consolidated power by systematically squashing dissent inside the country. This month, Parkhomenko\u2019s radio show and the whole independent Echo of Moscow network was taken off the air. The Kremlin\u2019s harsh new censorship law, punishable by 15 years in prison, makes it illegal to call the war in Ukraine a \u201cwar.\u201d \n\n\nSupport Reveal\u2019s journalism at <a href=\"https://checkout.fundjournalism.org/memberform?org_id=cir&amp;amount=15&amp;installmentPeriod=monthly&amp;utm_source=reveal-podcast&amp;utm_medium=partner-website&amp;utm_campaign=membership_2022_podcastdescription&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_term=&amp;campaign=7015d000001wAmaAAE\" target=\"_blank\">Revealnews.org/donatenow</a> \nSubscribe to our weekly newsletter to get the scoop on new episodes at <a href=\"https://revealnews.org/newsletter/?utm_source=reveal-podcast&amp;utm_medium=partner-website&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_2022_podcastdescription&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_term=&amp;campaign=\" target=\"_blank\">Revealnews.org/newsletter</a>\nConnect with us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reveal\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ThisIsReveal\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/revealnews/\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>\n\r\n      ",

In 2020, it re-emerged as a hashtag attached to baseless Republican claims of voter fraud, gained huge audiences on social media and became a rallying cry among the violent mob that stormed the U.S. Capitol building on Jan. 6, 2021. \n\nNext, reporter and guest host Ike Sriskandarajah looks into one reason people aren\u2019t getting the COVID-19 vaccine: conspiracy theories.

For the first time, Reveal tallies the number of intimate partners, children and bystanders whose lives are shattered by abusers who fail to give up their firearms. Our analysis of 21 states finds that from 2017 through 2020, at least 110 intimate partners, children and bystanders were killed by suspects using guns they weren\u2019t allowed to have under federal law and, in some cases, state law as well. This is likely a massive undercount because the federal government does not track the number of people killed by intimate partners who are prohibited from possessing guns. \n\nWe meet Chad Absher, who even as a young man could not control his rage. He was convicted of shooting at an ex-girlfriend's house, which meant he could never have a gun again. Absher\u2019s story with guns should have ended there, but it didn\u2019t. \n\nGollan picks up his story years later when Absher starts dating another young woman, Ashlee Rucker. It isn\u2019t long before he becomes controlling and abusive, and Rucker wants out of the relationship. But Absher won\u2019t let go and, once again, threatens violence. Despite the law, he has a firearm. \n\nIn the final segment, Gollan tracks the law enforcement failures that make it possible for felons such as Absher to possess guns. From the local sheriff to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and a member of Congress, Gollan discovers that laws that have been on the books for decades have very few enforcement mechanisms.

Our analysis of 21 states finds that from 2017 through 2020, at least 110 intimate partners, children and bystanders were killed by suspects using guns they weren\u2019t allowed to have under federal law and, in some cases, state law as well.

From Fallujah in Iraq to tiny villages in Afghanistan and Yemen, Reveal reporter Anjali Kamat talks to three journalists about how America\u2019s so-called war on terror has shaped an entire generation. \n\nAnand Gopal is a foreign journalist who traveled across the Afghan countryside, meeting with Taliban commanders and trying to understand how people understood the war. He says when U.S. President George W. Bush divided the world into those who are \u201cwith us\u201d and those who are \u201cwith the terrorists,\u201d it was an oversimplification and had tragic consequences for Afghanistan. Within months of the invasion, the Taliban wanted to surrender, but 9/11 was fresh and the U.S. said no. Instead, the military allied with anti-Taliban warlords and incentivized them to hunt down \u201cterrorists.\u201d Gopal says thousands of innocent people were arrested, tortured and killed \u2013 which only galvanized the Taliban and drew more recruits to their ranks. \n\nTo many Americans, Fallujah is remembered as the site of two brutal battles where many Americans died during the invasion of Iraq. But to journalist Feurat Alani, it\u2019s also his parents\u2019 hometown. While American TVs filled with images of the city as a jihadist stronghold, Alani knew it was a bustling city full of regular people whose lives would be forever changed by the invasion. Alani recounts precious memories of Fallujah, like swimming in the Euphrates River with his cousins and seeing football matches with his uncles. But after the invasion, his family fell apart and the city was reduced to rubble. The football stadium turned into a cemetery, and joyful moments there became somber walks through gravestones.   \n\nFinally, journalist and filmmaker Safa Al Ahmad talks about what America\u2019s post-9/11 wars have done to Yemen, where drone strikes became part of everyday life for civilians. Al Ahmad recounts what it felt like to ride in a pickup truck, wondering if she would be targeted as the sound of a drone buzzed overhead. She saw on the ground how the tactics of the war on terror in Yemen led to resentment and hostility among people whose lives were upended. While the 9/11 attacks happened 20 years ago, Al Ahmad says that for people in other places, bombings, airstrikes and drone attacks have never stopped. \u201cThey're still living the nightmare that people in New York lived for the day,\u201d she says.\r\n      ",

Methane leaks are heating up the planet and harming people who live where gas drilling takes place. \n\nReporter Elizabeth Shogren introduces us to a NASA scientist who\u2019s devoting his career to hunting down big methane leaks. Riley Duren and his team have figured out how to spot methane pollution from airplane flyovers, and in an experiment, his data was used to make polluters plug their leaks. Scientists have answers to the methane problem. The question is whether governments will step up to fund a comprehensive methane monitoring system. \n\nNext, Shogren zooms in on Arlington, Texas, a community that bet heavily on drilling for methane, the main ingredient in natural gas. There are wells all over Arlington, next to homes and shopping centers, even day cares and schools. Arlington\u2019s children have unwittingly been part of an experiment to see what happens when gas wells and people mix.\n\nWe end the show with a story from Reveal\u2019s Brett Simpson about a serious source of methane that is often overlooked.

But state officials had cited the facility dozens of times for problems including excessive force by staff, poor supervision and neglect.  \nRiverside was just one residential treatment center run by Sequel. In a yearlong investigation, APM Reports found the company profited by taking in some of the most difficult-to-treat children and providing them with care from low-paid, low-skilled employees. The result has been dozens of cases of physical violence, sexual assault and improper restraints. Despite repeated scandals, many states and counties continue to send kids to Sequel for one central reason: They have little choice.\nFor much of its 20 year history, Sequel was able to avoid public scrutiny. But that changed recently in Oregon, when State Senator Sara Gesler began to investigate the conditions of kids the state placed under the company\u2019s care.

            "contentSnippet": "Congress spent hundreds of billions of dollars to rescue small businesses hurt by the pandemic. But Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) money disproportionately went to White neighborhoods, leaving communities of color behind.\nSmall businesses are the heart of Los Angeles\u2019 many neighborhoods. Reporter Laura C. Morel talks with business owners around Los Angeles who either received PPP money or faced insurmountable hurdles to get one of the forgivable loans. Morel talks with a Latinx barber in the Florence neighborhood, where just 10% of businesses got PPP loans. In a predominantly Black area of Inglewood, we meet clothing store owner Annie Graham, who couldn\u2019t get a PPP loan last year, even from a lender who hooked up with Magic Johnson to specifically help minority- and women-owned businesses access the government lending program. In Graham\u2019s neighborhood, 32% of businesses got PPP loans. Meanwhile, in the majority-White neighborhood of Playa del Rey, 61% of businesses got PPP loans. The disparity among neighboring communities is striking.\nWe end with an interview with reporter Gabriel Thompson about fast food franchises that received PPP money. One McDonald\u2019s owner in Chicago got half a million dollars, but workers there filed multiple complaints with OSHA because they felt they were not protected from COVID-19.\nThis show is guest hosted by Sarah Gonzalez of Planet Money.\n\nDon\u2019t miss out on the next big story.
