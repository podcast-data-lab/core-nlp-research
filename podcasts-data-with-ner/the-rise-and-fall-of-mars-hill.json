It only took 474 days for him to announce he was planting a new church in Scottsdale, Arizona.\nBut while Driscoll wielded his own force of personality to get as much distance from Mars Hill as possible, life in Seattle was a different story. A confused and hurting church was displaced, hundreds of people were out of their jobs, and the fiercest critics of the church practically threw a party.\nIn our series finale, we follow a few of those threads, which led some people to new ministries, others to new careers, and still others out of the church altogether. We\u2019ll revisit the legacy of Driscoll\u2019s teaching on gender, and we\u2019ll ask whether or not he really preached good news and freedom.\nWe\u2019ll also look for the presence of Christ, working in surprising and unseen ways to bring beauty out of the ashes of what was once Mars Hill Church.\nAs we end 2021, we\u2019d love to invite you to join us as we continue to try to tell stories like this.

Though he prized the image of a solo, entrepreneurial pastor, Driscoll found early success thanks to two co-planters, a sending church, and a network of support. And three thousand miles away in Boca Raton, Florida, the concept of the Acts 29 church network was already taking shape as an offshoot of the Spanish River Church Planting Network.\nChurch planting requires a certain audacity, and in the early 1970\u2019s nobody had more than David Nicholas. Founder of Spanish River Church, David\u2019s burden for evangelism took shape in mentoring relationships with pastors starting congregations of their own. A planter himself, David empathized with those who felt lonely in that particular calling, and he sought to encourage and empower leaders by offering them community -- a network in which they could receive the care, training and accountability to do their jobs well. \nIn this episode of The Rise and Fall of Mars Hill, host Mike Cosper invites us into the room with David Nicholas and Mark Driscoll -- two church planters with widely divergent visions for what constituted successful church growth. Tracing the Acts 29 network from its beginnings, Cosper asks whether any leadership potential is worth overlooking red flags, and whether the broader church actually has what it takes to mentor young leaders with issues of character. \n\n\u201cThe Rise and Fall of Mars Hill\u201d is a production of Christianity Today \nExecutive Producer: Erik Petrik\nProduced, written, edited, and hosted by: Mike Cosper\nAdditional editing by Resonate Recordings and Matt Linder\nAssociate produced by Joy Beth Smith \nMusic, sound design, and mixing: Kate Siefker\nTheme song: \u201cSticks and Stones\u201d by King\u2019s Kaleidescope\nClosing song: \u201cCitizens\u201d by Jon Guerra\nGraphic Design: Bryan Todd\nSocial Media: Nicole Shanks\nEditorial consulting: Andrea Palpant Dilley, Online Managing Editor\nChristianity Today Editor in Chief: Timothy Dalrymple\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Step onto the basketball courts at Indiana University and behind the pulpit at Mars Hill to see how power becomes a strong drug that justifies abuse, keeps truth from speaking, and distances us from our shared humanity.\n\n\u201cThe Rise and Fall of Mars Hill\u201d is a production of Christianity Today \nExecutive Producer: Erik Petrik\nProduced, written, edited, and hosted by: Mike Cosper\nAdditional editing by Resonate Recordings and Matt Linder\nAssociate produced by Joy Beth Smith \nMusic, sound design, and mixing: Kate Siefker\nTheme song: \u201cSticks and Stones\u201d by King\u2019s Kaleidescope\nClosing song: \u201cAnger\u201d by Treva Blomquist\nGraphic Design: Bryan Todd\nSocial Media: Nicole Shanks\nEditorial consulting: Andrea Palpant Dilley, Online Managing Editor\nChristianity Today Editor in Chief: Timothy Dalrymple\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Drawing from his own difficult childhood story, Mark created an ideal for those searching for meaning and direction. Men responded enthusiastically. From \u201cdad talks\u201d about issues about sex, career and family to \u201choly anger\u201d over a feminized church culture, he invited men into a stirring narrative where manning up meant passionately loving God and their families. \nIn this episode of The Rise and Fall of Mars Hill, host Mike Cosper digs deep into the mythic origin story that shaped Mark Driscoll\u2019s ministry to men. He reveals Mark as far more than just an agent of chaos but a man deeply concerned for the health and spirituality of other men, intent on pastoring them toward flourishing. And as Driscoll\u2019s particular brand of masculinity grew toxic, Cosper asks the poignant question, \u201cWhy do you stay when things get bad?\u201d How do you reckon with the movement of the Spirit in your midst when your community begins to shatter? \n\n\u201cThe Rise and Fall of Mars Hill\u201d is a production of Christianity Today \nExecutive Producer: Erik Petrik\nProduced, written, edited, and hosted by: Mike Cosper\nMusic, sound design, and mixing: Kate Siefker\nGraphic Design: Bryan Todd\nSocial Media: Nicole Shanks\nEditorial consulting: Andrea Palpant Dilley, Online Managing Editor\nChristianity Today Editor in Chief: Timothy Dalrymple\nTheme song: \u201cSticks and Stones\u201d by King\u2019s Kaleidescope\nClosing song: \"Dynamite\" by Sandra McCracken?\nLearn more about your ad choices.

                "summary": "In the mid-1950s, Rev. Robert Schuller began preaching in a drive-in movie theater in Southern California. He melded traditions like vestments with a theology of post-war optimism and self-esteem. As his ministry grew, guest preaching in his pulpit became a mark of celebrity achievement. Three decades after his drive-in movie days, Schuller would welcome a young Mark Driscoll to the microphone to speak.\nTo understand the Mars Hill phenomenon, you have to understand how big churches developed in the boomer and Gen X years, how the franchising of churches led to homogenized congregational culture, and how pastors became spokesmen and CEOs. When Mark Driscoll arrived to preach at the Crystal Cathedral, he had already walked a ministry path paved by the likes of Schuller, Bill Hybels, and Rick Warren\u2014leaders who dedicated significant time to demographic research as well as expository study.\nIn this episode of The Rise and Fall of Mars Hill, host Mike Cosper flips the tapestry of the Mars Hill story to expose the weaving of threads beneath. He explores how the identity of a church can become wrapped around one man and why a host of leaders might fall in step to protect him in order to save the institution.\nHere, you can read an interview with David Di Sabatino, director of Frisbee: The Life and Death of a Hippie Preacher.\nThe Rise and Fall of Mars Hill is a production of Christianity Today\nExecutiver Producer: Erik Petrik\nProducer, Writer, and Host: Mike Cosper\nAssociate Producer: Joy Beth Smith\nMusic, sound design, and mixing: Kate Siefker\nGraphic Design: Bryan Todd\nSocial Media: Nicole Shanks\nEditorial consulting: Andrea Palpant Dilley, online managing editor\nChristianity Today Editor in Chief: Timothy Dalrymple\nTheme song: \u201cSticks and Stones\u201d by King\u2019s Kaleidescope\nClosing song: \u201cCrush\u201d by The Violet Burning\nLearn more about your ad choices.

But in the next 18 years, it would become one of the largest, fastest-growing, and most influential churches in the United States. Controversy plagued the church, though, due in no small part to the lightning-rod personality at its helm: Mark Driscoll.\nBy 2014, the church had grown to 15,000 people in 15 locations. But before the year was over, the church collapsed. On January 1st, 2015, Mars Hill was gone.\nHosted by Mike Cosper, The Rise and Fall of Mars Hill explores the inside story of this church, its charismatic leader, and the conflicts and troubles that brought about its end. You'll hear from insiders and experts, tracing the threads of this story to so many others that shape the church today.\nListen to the trailer and subscribe today. The full series launches on June 22nd.\nExecutive Produced by Erik Petrik\nProduced, Written, and Edited by Mike Cosper\nAssociate Produced by Joy Beth Smith\nLearn more about your ad choices.

But in the next 18 years, it would become one of the largest, fastest-growing, and most influential churches in the United States.
