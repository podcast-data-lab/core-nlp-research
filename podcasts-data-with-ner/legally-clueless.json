This was one of my favourite stories to record because of the clarity he has on his grief. I found myself learning a lot about my own grief from him! Not to mention he has got me very interested in getting an ancestral reading from a sangoma too! \n\nNext here are the songs we're diggin this week. I recommend you check out Glory by Nyashinski: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxjX9nbl84U\nAnd blogger behind \"thatnicte.wordpress.com\" sent this song to the #LegallyClueless hotline: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ism8dBjxKvc\n\nI know during this pandemic it's easy to feel helpless so I'll keep sharing various ways that you can help especially vulnerable communities. My friend Billian in this episode shares what his organization and others are doing to help families in Mathare.  Here's the paybill information he mentioned:\nPaybill - 891300\nAccount - 39406\nMchanga link: https://changa.page.link/7V1Us\n\nLastly, send through your 1minute demo via whatsapp audio note to the hotline number for a chance to share your story on Legally Clueless! I appreciate all of you whose stories I recorded last week. It's such a honour to receive your stories, honestly!\n\nAnyway, hope you enjoy this episode!"
