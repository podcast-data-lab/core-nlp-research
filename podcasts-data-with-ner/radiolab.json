For over a year, Elsa, Lulu and the Radiolab team dug through primary sources, talked to experts, even visited Helen\u2019s birthplace Ivy Green, and discovered the real story of Helen Keller is far more complicated, mysterious and confounding than the simple myth of a young Deafblind girl rescued by her teacher Annie Sullivan. It\u2019s a story of ghosts, surprises, a few tears, a bit of romance, some hard conversations, and a possibly psychic dog.<em>This episode was reported by Elsa Sjunneson and Lulu Miller. It was produced by Sindhu Gnanasambandan and Rachel Cusick, with help from Sarah Qari, Tanya Chawla, and Carolyn McClusker. </em><em>Jeremy Bloom contributed music and sound design. Additional Mixing by Arianne Wack.</em></p>\n<p><em>Special thanks to Georgina Kleege, Julia Bascom, Desiree Kocis, Peter C. Kunze, Andrew Leland, Sara Luterman, Alexander Richey, Will Healy, Nate Jones, Nate Peereboom, and Pamela Sabaugh (who was our voice of Helen Keller).ASL TRANSCRIPTION</em></p>\n<p><em>Support Radiolab by becoming a member of <a href=\"https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/membership\">The Lab</a> today.    </em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaum_fMDGgFQCmKHUBPq_xg\">Radiolab is on YouTube!</a> Catch up with new episodes and hear classics from our archive.

It was as if researchers said collectively, \"It's just going to be empty up there, and we've got our hands full studying the trees down here! So why bother?!\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">But then, around the mid-1980s, a few ecologists around the world got curious and started making their way up into the treetops using any means necessary (ropes, cranes, hot air dirigibles) to document all they could find. It didn't take long for them to realize not only was the forest canopy not empty, it was absolutely </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">filled to the brim</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> with life. You've heard of treehouses? How about tree </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">gardens</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">?! </span></p>\r\n<p><span>This week we journey up into the sky and discover Forests above the forest. We learn about the secret powers of these sky gardens from ecologist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/korenamafune\">Korena Mafune</a>, and we follow <a href=\"https://nalininadkarni.com/\">Nalini Nadkarni</a> as she makes a ground-breaking discovery that changes how we understand what trees are capable of. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>P.S. This episode is a layer cake of arboreal surprises (including the reappearance of a certain retired host). </span></p>\r\n<p><strong>A few visual tre(e)ats: </strong></p>\r\n<p><span>We first learned about the magical world of the canopy from </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRd8_Tu7YDs&amp;ab_channel=PBSTerra\"><span>this beautiful video</span></a><span> from Michael Werner, Joe Hanson, and the PBS Overview team. It features Korena Mafune\u2019s research up in the treetops, as well as the people who have dedicated their lives to saving what\u2019s left of the old growth forests. We highly recommend checking it out! <br></span><br><span>And, if you\u2019re hankering to go climb a tree after this episode, you might enjoy browsing Hallie Bateman\u2019s </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/09/03/magazine/04mag-trees.html?_r=0\"><span>wonderfully illustrated guide</span></a><span> to the best climbing trees in NYC for a little inspiration.<br><br></span><strong><em>Support Radiolab by becoming a member today at </em></strong><a href=\"https://pledge3.wnyc.org/donate/radiolab/onestep/\"><em><span>Radiolab.org/donate</span></em></a><strong><em>.<br><br></em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaum_fMDGgFQCmKHUBPq_xg\"><strong>Radiolab is on YouTube!</strong></a> <span>Catch up with new episodes and hear classics from our archive.

A supervolcano. The disappearance of shadows. A failure of bread. Plague rats. Using evidence painstakingly gathered around the world - from Mongolian tree rings to Greenlandic ice cores to Mayan artifacts - we paint a portrait of what scientists and historians think went wrong, and what we think it felt like to be there in real time.

But, in a last ditch effort to flip the flop, we at Radiolab have dredged up the most mortifying, most cringeworthy, most gravity-defying flops we could find. From flops at a community pool to flops at the White House, from a flop that derails a career to flops that give NBA players a sneaky edge, from flops that\u2019ll send you seeking medical advice to THE flopped flop that in a way enabled us all. Take a break from all the disappointment and flop around with us.</p>\n<p>Special Thanks to: <em>Kaitlin Murphy, Dana Stevens, David Novak, Pablo Pinero Stillman</em></p>\n<p><em>Support Radiolab by becoming a member today at <a href=\"https://pledge3.wnyc.org/donate/radiolab/onestep/\">Radiolab.org/donate</a>. </em></p>"

And we need your help to save it.\u201d <br></span><br><span>Nick had never even heard of the butterfly. In fact, he barely knew much about butterflies in general. Nonetheless, he said yes to Uncle Sam. \u201c</span><em><span>How hard could it be?\u201d</span></em><span> he wondered. Turns out, pretty hard.

Over the last decade, those 60 words have become the legal foundation for the \"war on terror.\"</p>\n<p>In this collaboration with BuzzFeed, reporter Gregory Johnsen tells us the story of how this has come to be one of the most important, confusing, troubling sentences of the last two decades. We go into the meetings that took place in the chaotic days just after 9/11, speak with Congresswoman Barbara Lee and former Congressman Ron Dellums about the vote on the AUMF. We hear from former White House and State Department lawyers John Bellinger &amp; Harold Koh. We learn how this legal language unleashed Guantanamo, Navy Seal raids and drone strikes. And we speak with journalist Daniel Klaidman, legal expert Benjamin Wittes and Virginia Senator Tim Kaine about how these words came to be interpreted, and what they mean for the future of war and peace.</p>\n<p>Finally, we check back in with Congresswoman Lee, and talk to Yale law professor and national security expert Oona Hathaway, about how to move on from the original sixty words.</p>\n<p><em>Original episode produced by Matt Kielty and Kelsey Padgett with original music by Dylan Keefe.

She told the judge, \"I was told right now in the conservatorship, I'm not able to get married or have a baby.\" Today, we look back at an old episode where we explore why it is that hundreds of thousands of people can have their reproductive rights denied...and spoiler: it goes back to Darwin.\nWhen a law student named Mark Bold came across a Supreme Court decision from the 1920s that allowed for the forced sterilization of people deemed \u201cunfit,\u201d he was shocked to discover that it had never been overturned.

In this episode we follow Mark on a journey to one of the darkest consequences of humanity\u2019s attempts to measure the human mind and put people in boxes, following him through history, science fiction and a version of eugenics that\u2019s still very much alive today, and watch as he crusades to restore a dash of moral order to the universe.\nThis episode was produced by Matt Kielty, Lulu Miller and Pat Walters. \nSpecial thanks to Sara Luterman, Lynn Rainville, Alex Minna Stern, Steve Silberman and Lydia X.Z.

And so too, he quickly found, would be the attention. </p>\n<p>This episode, producer Simon Adler follows Corey as he dodges death threats and prepares to pull the trigger.  Along the way we stop to talk with Namibian hunters and government officials, American activists, and someone who's been here before - Kenya\u2019s former Director of Wildlife, Richard Leakey.   All the while, we try to uncover what conservation really means in the 21st century.</p>\n<p><em>Reported &amp; produced by Simon Adler with production help from Matthew Kielty.</em></p>\n<em>Special thanks to Chris Weaver, Ian Wallace, Mark Barrow, the Lindstrom family, and everyone at the Aru Game Lodge in Namibia.</em>\n<p><em>Thanks also to Sarah Fogel, Ray Crow, Barbara Clucus, and Diogo Veríssimo.</em></p>\n<p><em>Support Radiolab by becoming a member today at <a href=\"https://pledge3.wnyc.org/donate/radiolab-it/onestep/?utm_source=wnyc&amp;utm_medium=radiolab-redirect&amp;utm_campaign=pledge&amp;utm_content=show-notes\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pledge\">Radiolab.org/donate</a>.  </em> </p>"

In this update, Li-Huei tells us about her team\u2019s latest research, which now includes flashing <em>sound</em>, and ways in which light and sound together might retrieve lost memories. This new science is not a cure, and is far from a treatment, but it\u2019s a finding so \u2026 simple, you won\u2019t be able to shake it. Come join us for a lab visit, where we\u2019ll meet some mice, stare at some light, and come face-to-face with the mystery of memory. We can promise you: by the end, you\u2019ll never think the same way about Christmas lights again. Or jingle bells.\n\n<p><em>This update was reported by Molly Webster, and </em><em>produced by Rachael Cusick. </em>The original episode was produced by Annie McEwen, Matt Kielty, and Molly Webster, with help from Simon Adler. </p>\n<p><em>Special thanks to Ed Boyden, Cognito Therapeutics, Brad Dickerson, Karen Duff, Zaven Khachaturian, Michael Lutz, Kevin M.

It was a constitution of sorts, laying out what could and what couldn\u2019t be posted on the site. Back then, the rules were simple, outlawing nudity and gore. Today, they\u2019re anything but. </p>\n<p>How do you define hate speech? Where\u2019s the line between a joke and an attack? How much butt is too much butt? Facebook has answered these questions. And from these answers they\u2019ve written a rulebook that all 2.2 billion of us are expected to follow. Today, we explore that rulebook. We dive into its details and untangle its logic. All the while wondering what does this mean for the future of free speech?</p>\n<p><em>This episode was reported by Simon Adler with help from Tracie Hunte and was produced by Simon Adler with help from Bethel Habte.</em></p>\n<p><em>Special thanks to Sarah Roberts, Jeffrey Rosen, Carolyn Glanville, Ruchika Budhraja, Brian Dogan, Ellen Silver, James Mitchell, Guy Rosen, Mike Masnick, and our voice actor Michael Chernus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Support Radiolab today at <a href=\"https://pledge3.wnyc.org/donate/radiolab-it/onestep/?utm_source=podcast&amp;utm_medium=notes&amp;utm_campaign=membership&amp;utm_content=radiolab\" target=\"_blank\">Radiolab.org/donate</a>. </em></p>"

Until one day when he makes a bizarre and shocking discovery. He shares his name with another man: Abdul Latif Nasser, detainee 244 at Guantanamo Bay. The U.S. government paints a terrifying picture of The Other Latif as Al-Qaeda\u2019s top explosives expert, and one of the most important advisors to Osama bin Laden. Nasser\u2019s lawyer claims that he was at the wrong place at the wrong time, and that he was never even in Al-Qaeda. This clash leads Radiolab\u2019s Latif into a years-long investigation, picking apart evidence, attempting to separate fact from fiction, and trying to uncover what this man actually did or didn\u2019t do. Along the way, Radiolab\u2019s Latif reflects on American values and his own religious past, and wonders how his namesake, a fellow nerdy, suburban Muslim kid, may have gone down such a strikingly different path.\n \nEpisode 1: My Namesake\nWe hear the evidence against Abdul Latif Nasser -- at least the evidence that has been leaked or declassified -- and we meet Shelby Sullivan-Bennis, his attorney, who contests more or less every government claim against him. Sullivan-Bennis walks us through the excruciating process that came close to releasing Abdul Latif Nasser in the waning days of the Obama administration, but fell apart at the last minute.

We examine how just 60 words of legal language have blurred the line between war and peace.</p> <p>Last weekend President Trump authorized a strike that killed Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in Iraq. The news had us thinking about an episode we produced in 2014. We pulled apart one sentence, written in the hours after September 11th, 2001, that has led to the longest war in U.S. history. We examine how just 60 words of legal language have blurred the line between war and peace.</p>\r\n<p>In the hours after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, a lawyer sat down in front of a computer and started writing a legal justification for taking action against those responsible. The language that he drafted and that President George W. Bush signed into law - called the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) -  has at its heart one single sentence, 60 words long. Over the last decade, those 60 words have become the legal foundation for the \"war on terror.\"</p>\r\n<p>In this collaboration with BuzzFeed, reporter Gregory Johnsen tells us the story of how this has come to be one of the most important, confusing, troubling sentences of the last two decades.

We examine how just 60 words of legal language have blurred the line between war and peace.\n Last weekend President Trump authorized a strike that killed Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in Iraq. The news had us thinking about an episode we produced in 2014. We pulled apart one sentence, written in the hours after September 11th, 2001, that has led to the longest war in U.S. history. We examine how just 60 words of legal language have blurred the line between war and peace.\n\r\nIn the hours after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, a lawyer sat down in front of a computer and started writing a legal justification for taking action against those responsible. The language that he drafted and that President George W. Bush signed into law - called the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) -  has at its heart one single sentence, 60 words long. Over the last decade, those 60 words have become the legal foundation for the \"war on terror.\"\n\r\nIn this collaboration with BuzzFeed, reporter Gregory Johnsen tells us the story of how this has come to be one of the most important, confusing, troubling sentences of the last two decades. We go into the meetings that took place in the chaotic days just after 9/11, speak with Congresswoman Barbara Lee and former Congressman Ron Dellums about the vote on the AUMF. We hear from former White House and State Department lawyers John Bellinger & Harold Koh. We learn how this legal language unleashed Guantanamo, Navy Seal raids and drone strikes. And we speak with journalist Daniel Klaidman, legal expert Benjamin Wittes and Virginia Senator Tim Kaine about how these words came to be interpreted, and what they mean for the future of war and peace.\n\r\nFinally, we check back in with Wittes, to see how the AUMF has trickled into the 2020s.\n\r\nProduced by Matt Kielty and Kelsey Padgett with original music by Dylan Keefe. \n\r\nWatch Congresswomen Barbara Lee's speech here.",
