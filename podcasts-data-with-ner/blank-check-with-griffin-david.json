A man who has *actually collaborated with John Carpenter* - Drew McWeeny (writer of Carpenter\u2019s installments in the Masters of Horror series) - joins us to recontextualize our journey through Carpenter\u2019s filmography with some exclusive behind-the-scenes tidbits. The Two Friends also discuss the strange career trajectory of Amber Heard (starting with the festival-smash-that-doesn\u2019t-exist ALL THE BOYS LOVE MANDY LANE), present their final Carpenter rankings, and reveal which Auteur they\u2019ll cover on the podcast next.

Ben goes Hollywood (actually, \u201cHosleywood\u201d) to record with Emily Yoshida - the Mother of Blankies herself - *in person* in Los Angeles, and the gang debates possible names for the series. We landed on \u201cThey Podcast\u201d - which is a departure from Griffin\u2019s far sweatier suggestions. Join us as we set the table for Carpenter\u2019s filmography, and go deep on this film, which could also just be called \u201cSpace Dirtbags,\u201d per Emily.\n\n\nJoin our Patreon at patreon.com/blankcheck\n\nFollow us @blankcheckpod on Twitter and Instagram!\nBuy some real nerdy merch at shopblankcheckpod.myshopify.com"
