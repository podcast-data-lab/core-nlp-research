In \u201cLost Dreams,\u201d we hear the stories of three people who followed their deepest passion and endured devastation: Perdita Felicien, a world-champion hurdler who was favored to win gold at the 2004 Olympics, then tripped and fell in what would be her last-ever appearance on the Olympic track; Dylan Evans, an esteemed psychologist who abandoned his academic career to build a utopian community in the Scottish Highlands, only to see that community unravel and find himself detained in a psychiatric hospital; and Sara Brooke Curtis, a mother whose first child died at just three-days-old and who now readies herself for the birth of her second baby.
