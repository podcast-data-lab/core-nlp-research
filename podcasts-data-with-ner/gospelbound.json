But by believing that we are our own, we tend to struggle with new problems: the loss of meaning, identity, and purpose.</p><p>Noble says this in his new book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/You-Are-Not-Your-Own/dp/0830847820/?tag=thegospcoal-20\"><i>You Are Not Your Own: Belonging to God in an Inhuman World</i></a>, published by InterVarsity:</p><p>Everyone is on their own private journey of self-discovery and self-expression so that at times, modern life feels like billions of people in the same room shouting their name so that everyone else knows they exist and who they are\u2014which is a fairly accurate description of social media.</p><p>Noble\u2019s book feels like a douse of cold water that wakes us from our delusion. His book builds off the first question and answer of the Heidelberg Catechism. And he helps us find our way back to this well-worn path of divine wisdom. He writes, \u201cOur selves belong to God, and we are joyfully limited and restrained by the obligations, virtues, and love that naturally come from this belonging.\u201d</p><p>Noble is assistant professor of English at Oklahoma Baptist University and co-founder and editor in chief of Christ and Pop Culture.

But the moment we expressed the pain we felt about \u2018racial injustice,\u2019 many White Christians were quick to dismiss us, rebuke us, or silently ignore us.\u201d\nEven so, Shai\u2019s book points to hope for ethnic unity. It\u2019s a book that cuts through the anger, sarcasm, unforgiveness, and mockery that characterize much Christian discourse today on this sensitive subject. He points us toward a better way of humility, gentleness, patience, and bearing with one another in love. Apart from massive revival, we may not expect the world to overcome these divisions. But in the church, through the power of the gospel, we can strive for unity and be a clear and compelling witness to the world.\nShai Linne joined me on Gospelbound to discuss the importance of ethnic unity and how we might get there.\nThis episode Gospelbound is sponsored by The Good Book Company, publisher of Faith For Life.  More information at thegoodbook.com.",

            "content:encoded": "<p>For Shai Linne, the cultural differences in music and dress never seemed to matter compared to unity in the crucified and risen Christ. Shai became a key figure in the growing movement of Christian hip-hop, musically like Wu-tang Clan but lyrically like Billy Graham. The style was appealing, but the crowds seemed more excited about Jesus than anything else. He\u2019s convinced that we\u2019ll look back one day on this era, between 2002 and 2012, as a revival much like the Jesus Movement of the late 1960s and early \u201970s.</p><p>In 2012, ethnic differences began to re-emerge with the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. As Shai writes in his new book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/New-Reformation-Finding-Fight-Ethnic/dp/0802423205/?tag=thegospcoal-20\"><i>The New Reformation: Finding Hope in the Fight for Ethnic Unit</i></a><i>y </i>(Moody), the subsequent high-profile shooting deaths of black men and women did not surprise many African Americans. His sense as a 16-year-old was that police beat up Black people all the time. But Christian hip-hop began to decline when White and Black Christians realized they did not see these incidents the same way.

I've heard Carl say that apologetics used to be about explaining the church to the world, but now it's more about explaining the world to the church. That's what he does in <i>The Rise and Triumph of the Modern Self</i>, which is my pick for the most important book published in 2020. </p><p>I'm eager to learn more about this road to revolution, and also pose some of our listeners' questions on this subject.</p><p> </p><p>This episode of Gospelbound is sponsored by Crossway, publisher of <a href=\"https://www.crossway.org/books/the-rise-and-triumph-of-the-modern-self-hcj/\"><i><strong>The Rise and Triumph of the Modern Self: Cultural Amnesia, Expressive Individualism, and the Road to Sexual Revolution</strong></i></a> by Carl Trueman. </p>\n"

            "content:encoded": "<p>It\u2019s not that Africa needs a different kind of Christianity. But many common challenges for ministry in Africa simply don\u2019t arise in books published in the West. That\u2019s why Conrad Mbewe wrote <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Gods-Design-Church-Ministry-Coalition/dp/1433566427?tag=thegospcoal-20\"><i><strong>God\u2019s Design for the Church: A Guide for African Pastors and Ministry Leaders</strong></i></a>, published by TGC and 9Marks with Crossway. The need for such a resource is tremendous: while about 9 million Christians lived in Africa at the beginning of the 20th century, that number reached 380 million by the year 2000. And it\u2019s still growing.</p><p>Conrad Mbewe has served as pastor of <a href=\"http://www.kabwatabaptistchurch.com/\">Kabwata Baptist Church</a> in Lusaka, Zambia, since 1987. He\u2019s a senior lecturer at African Christian University, founding Council member of TGC Africa, and past keynote speaker for The Gospel Coalition National Conference. In this book you\u2019ll get biblical and theological guidance that transcends time, continent, and culture. You\u2019ll see much appreciation for the strengths of African churches. And you\u2019ll also get Conrad\u2019s clear-eyed analysis of their weaknesses. For example, here are his comments on African preaching:</p><p>\"The popular sermons today are motivational speeches. They are based on worldly principles that promise people earthly benefits if they say the right words or do the right things. These draw the crowds, but the people are not interested in growth in holiness. They want entertainment and earthly treasures. There is also a very high turnover of congregants. Many become disillusioned because the principles they are being taught are not working for them and so they leave quietly. Many more come in and take their place, hoping that the magic formulas will work for them.\"</p><p>I don\u2019t think you\u2019d write something much different about the United States.</p><p>Conrad joins me on Gospelbound to discuss witchcraft, tribalism, the relationship between evangelism and mercy ministry, among other topics.</p><p> </p><p><i>Today\u2019s episode of Gospelbound is sponsored by the Christian Standard Bible, a translation that presents the truth of God\u2019s Word with accuracy and clarity for today\u2019s readers, equipping them for lifelong discipleship.

Now it\u2019s a little more than one in three. Membership in religious bodies has declined from more than 75 percent to 62 percent. And the number that gets all the attention is the \u201cnones,\u201d the Americans who claim no religion. That\u2019s now 25 percent, compared to just 5 percent in 1960.</p><p>It\u2019s hard to see that trend reversing with the unprecedented disruption of COVID-19. My own pastor estimates we\u2019ve lost 25 percent of our church during the pandemic.</p><p>Lyman Stone is an expert on both the decline of American religiosity and also the spread of COVID-19. Stone is an adjunct fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a research fellow at the Institute for Family Studies, and a former international economist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. He blogs about migration, population dynamics, and regional economics at <a href=\"https://medium.com/migration-issues\">In a State of Migration</a>. His work has been covered in the <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>TheWashington Post</i>, <i>TheWall Street Journal</i>, and numerous local outlets.</p><p>He joins me on Gospelbound to discuss his 2020 report \u201c<a href=\"https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Promise-and-Peril.pdf\">Promise and Peril: The History of American Religiosity and Its Recent Decline</a>.\u201d</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><i>Today's episode of Gospelbound is sponsored by the Christian Standard Bible, a translation that presents the truth of God\u2019s Word with accuracy and clarity for today\u2019s readers, equipping them for lifelong discipleship.

Michael and Lauren write to their millennial peers, which includes me, born in 1981.</p><p>In <i>Not What You Think</i>, Michael and Lauren are honest about themselves and Bible. Which is appropriate, since unpolished honesty is what you get in the Bible. They write:</p><p>\u201cThe Bible is a unique source of comfort because, compared with all the other books on the market today, the Bible is the most honest about the failures of humankind. . . . You will not find a more authentic ancient religious text than the Bible.\u201d</p><p>You may think Job is about finding a job, as Michael\u2019s friend did.

She writes that, \u201cA crucial ministry of same-sex-attracted Christians is to point to the validity of God\u2019s word over our deep feelings.\u201d And that\u2019s why I so appreciate this book, not only for readers who can identify with her particular story. It challenges the rest of us to follow Christ, even when we don\u2019t feel like it.</p><p>Gilson joins me on Gospelbound to discuss when she changed her mind about Christianity being stupid and cruel, how she found acceptance and joy in Christian community, and her views on campus evangelism today.</p><p> </p><p><i>This episode of Gospelbound is sponsored by Southeastern Seminary, equipping today\u2019s ministry leaders with the Word of God, a philosophical foundation, and care for the lost through their Masters program in Ethics, Theology, and Culture and the Ph.D. in Public Theology.
