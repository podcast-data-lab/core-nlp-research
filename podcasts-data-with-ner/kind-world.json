Actually, the biggest, most dramatic change in who can\u2019t cross right now; you\u2019re not going to find those folks at the official ports of entry. Instead, you have to look inside migrant shelters, at the refugees who can\u2019t seek asylum in the U.S. right now and are instead stuck in border towns. So that's what we do today. We talk to a migrant stuck at the border in Tijuana, and a doctor from Los Angeles who's trying to help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About The Show:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cPort Of Entry\u201d is about the unexplored subcultures, creativity and struggles at the U.S.-Mexico border. The KPBS podcast tells personal stories from people whose lives are shaped by the tension reverberating around the wall. This is a show for border babies, urban explorers or those who wonder what happens when two cultures are both separated and intertwined.</p>"
