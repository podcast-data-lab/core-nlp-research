And for Black women on reality TV, we ask \"what is the physical and mental cost to be the boss?\" As more Black women ascend to reality TV stardom, let\u2019s have a conversation about the perception of us on screen, the stigmas attached, who deserves their flowers and who needs a bigger check. To add to the discussion, we have a very special guest that you do NOT want to miss! Yes, your favorite Georgia Peach - entrepreneur, personality and BFF (in your head) and now author, Porsha Williams. We discuss her journey on the Real Housewives of Atlanta and she shares an authentic lens of who she is today through her new book, The Pursuit of Porsha.\n\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information."
