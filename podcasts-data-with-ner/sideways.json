They would sing at the drop of a hat and James' father had a barbershop quartet. \n\nEvery Monday evening James would listen attentively to the sumptuous close harmonies and his father taught him and his siblings to harmonise too. James took this into his adult years. It gave him a lifelong enjoyment and confidence to harmonise with other people, just for fun. One day, when his father is taken very ill, James realises the power of harmony at the hardest of times as he and his family join around his father's hospital bed to sing.\n\nIn this episode, Matthew Syed explores the importance of harmony and asks whether bringing in musical ideas could help bring us a little more harmony in our lives. We get a lesson in close harmony singing with folk trio Lady Maisery and consider how the principles of close listening could carry beyond a musical setting.\n\nAnd Matthew explores Plato's ideas about the soul in harmony with Professor Angie Hobbs, the Professor of the Public Understanding of Philosophy at the University of Sheffield. And with Ian Cross, Emeritus Professor of Music and Science at the University of Cambridge, Matthew unravels the ways we communicate musically in conversation to signal agreement and to bond, showing the vital importance of musical interaction in bonding.\n\nPresenter: Matthew Syed\nProducer and Series Editor: Katherine Godfrey\nExecutive Producer: Max O'Brien\nMusic, Sound Design and Mix: Rob Speight\nTheme music by Ioana Selaru.\nA Novel production for BBC Radio 4.",

In San Francisco's Candlestick Park stadium, a pair of local sporting rivals are about to go head to head - the Oakland Athletics against the San Francisco Giants.\n\nBut before the first ball is pitched, the game is interrupted - by a major earthquake. A section of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge - the major transport connection for the two northern Californian cities - crumbles, killing one person. And across the Bay in West Oakland, a double decker freeway collapses. 42 lives are lost.\n \nIn the months and years that follow, San Francisco and West Oakland face a seemingly simple question - how to rebuild. Two major projects emerge. But with very different results.

His new book lies ready to be pulped.\n\nIn the first of a new series of Sideways, Matthew Syed asks why we\u2019re doomed to be unoriginal and why it hurts so much to be, well, not that special.\n\nIn 1998, Hollywood directors Matthew Bay and Mimi Leder went head to head with suspiciously similar disaster movies -  Armageddon and Deep Impact. Allegations of late-night spying flew around. But could there have just been something in the air? Matthew reveals that, four years earlier, fragments of the Shoemaker-Levy 9 Comet smashed into Jupiter and right into the American consciousness.\n\nThis is the thing...

It is a cultural gift for unknown extraterrestrial life forms. If an alien species discovers this unique double LP, they'll be greeted by the singing of the Mbuti people of the Congo recorded by the anthropologist Colin Turnbull.\n\nMatthew Syed examines Turnbull's seemingly utopian experiences in the forest with the Mbuti and contrasts them with his utterly bleak account of the Ik people of Uganda. The Ik were, according to Turnbull, a \"loveless\" people devoid of culture, brutal and totally uncaring. He labelled them \"the most selfish people on earth\".\n\nTurnbull argued that the Ik offered a stark warning to westerners. This allegedly nightmarish society was, according to Turnbull, the way the west was headed.\n\nMatthew hears from Turnbull's critics who say he misunderstood the Ik and uses Turnbull's work to ask a profound question - is mankind fundamentally rotten and selfish at the core, or do kindness and compassion lie at the beating heart of human society?\n\nProducer: Mike Martinez\nMusic, Sound Design and Mix: Benbrick\nSeries Editor: Russell Finch\nExecutive Producers: Sean Glynn and Max O'Brien\n\nA Novel production for BBC Radio 4"
