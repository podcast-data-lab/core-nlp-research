To hear more episodes in this series, go to deathsexmoney.org/class. \n\r\nJaimie wrote a piece for BuzzFeed about her class transition after her divorce. Read it here.",

And when she was 25 years old, the kids came to live with her.\n\r\nBy that point, Yesi was already establishing her broadcasting career, and balancing her roles as a parent and a media personality wasn\u2019t easy. \"Every day was a game of chess,\" she says. \"I wouldn\u2019t miss a parent teacher conference or back-to-school night, but I would miss dinner.\" One thing she didn\u2019t want, though, was a man around the house. Her first date after getting the kids was on her front porch. \"I didn't want the kids to hear a man's voice in the house,\" Yesi told me. \"I didn't want them to feel like, 'Oh, my aunt is leaving us now too.'\"\n\r\nNow that several of the kids are grown and out of the house, she\u2019s had a little more time for herself, and for her new boyfriend. She spoke with me about how her faith was challenged by her family's struggles, how her new relationship has brought religion\u2014not sex\u2014back into her life, and why being a single parent is the hardest job in the world.\n\r\nThis episode is originally from 2015.",

But instead of it feeling like a relief, Tessa told me, \"I just felt like I really failed.\"\n\r\nI talk with Tessa and their sister, who we're calling Rose, about how they eventually made the decision for Tessa to file for bankruptcy\u2014and the ways that talking about money more openly together has led to some unexpected questions and answers about Tessa's spending habits. \n\r\nIf you're struggling with consumer debt, check out these resources.",

Tony started paying child support for his daughter near the end of the pregnancy, went to prenatal appointments, and took parenting classes along with the baby's mother. On the day his daughter was born, Tony cut the umbilical cord. </p>\r\n<p>And Tony was an active father. As soon as his daughter could take a bottle, he says he started sharing custody of her, sometimes watching her three or four days a week. \"We were really just good buddies,\" he says. \"It felt good to have purpose, and it felt amazing to love something so much, in a completely new way.\" </p>\r\n<p>Money became a source of tension, though, between Tony and the baby's mother. So did the fact that as his daughter got older, she started looking less like him or her mother. Tony decided to get a paternity test when his daughter was about a year old. \"I couldn't play it dumb forever,\" Tony says\u2014but he also feared the results. \"That's not something that you want to know, especially when you love something so much.\"</p>\r\n<p>Tony quickly learned the truth: he had a zero percent probability of being the biological father. He called the mother to tell her, and soon after that, he met Victor*, the man who is his daughter's biological father. Over beers, they talked about Tony's shock, Victor's suspicions from the sidelines, and their plan for the little girl they both considered a daughter. More than two years later, they joined me to talk about the logistics and emotions of the transition that followed, which included packing up a pickup truck with nursery furniture to move it from Tony's place to Victor's. </p>\r\n<p>This episode first aired in 2017. </p>\r\n<p>*Last names have been withheld for privacy reasons.</p>\r\n",

You can't expose yourself that often,\" she wrote. \"There is no time to know the people who slipped through your fingers\u2014whose hair you washed, whose body you bathed, who you talk to during your shift to soothe yourself and them.\" She added, \"It's simultaneously the most intimate and most anonymous relationship I've ever had.\" \n\r\nLindsay ended her email to us with a question: \"How do I as a nurse, or how do we as a healthcare community, give patients a good death during a pandemic?\" \n\r\nLet us know if you have thoughts or answers for Lindsay.

Some of you aren't having sex because you can't find the right partner or keep running into narrow societal standards about what\u2019s \u201cattractive.\u201d\n\r\nWe heard from people in relationships, too, like a couple who can't agree on how much sex is enough\u2014so they're not really having any. And a man who says everyone thinks his life is full of three-ways and orgies because he lives with his wife and their girlfriend. But in reality, he says they're not having sex at all. \n\r\nWhen we asked for your stories about why you\u2019re not having sex, you also told us that not having sex can be really difficult to talk about. But by talking about it, what becomes clear is that our idea of what's \"normal\" might in fact be a myth.",

Listener Sasha* told us about how she suspected that her partner of five years was having an affair -- and later, after they broke up, discovered that he had been been posting online ads for casual sex throughout their relationship. Andy in Connecticut remembered being a 12-year-old trying to convince his father not to cheat on a girlfriend. Joe* in Texas talked about having a relationship with a married woman as a single man, and the feeling of being a sideshow to the main event. Listener Chrystal* began her email to us about the cheating in her relationship: \"Spoiler alert: we made it.\" \n\r\nNumbers about cheating vary from study to study, but indicate that 20 to 40 percent of straight married men and 20 to 25 percent of straight married women venture outside their marriages. When Dan Savage joined us on the show in 2014, he put that number even higher, at 50 percent of women and men in long-term relationships. \n\r\nIn this episode, you'll hear from men and women who've cheated and been cheated on. Nobody's proud of it. But we learned that when a secret affair is revealed, it\u2019s a moment for us to finally and fully be honest about what was missing from a relationship, and what\u2019s worth saving.\n\r\n*Name changed for privacy reasons",

Plus, Carrie explains why she drank someone else's champagne on her wedding day.\n\r\n\r\nThis episode is part of Death, Sex & Money's 2019 Maternity Leave Lineup. Tayari Jones first joined us on the show in 2018 to talk about the freedoms of singlehood, and the call from Oprah that changed everything for her.",
