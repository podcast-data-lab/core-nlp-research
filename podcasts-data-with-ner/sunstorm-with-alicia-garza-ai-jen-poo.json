Writer, podcast host, and all-around badass Aminatou Sow tells Alicia and Ai-jen why she believes that everything worth doing takes time\u2014and why it\u2019s so important to fight for ourselves and for those who come after us. The ladies also smash misconceptions about self-care (spoiler alert: it\u2019s not just mani-pedis, it\u2019s political) and discuss Shine Theory, a concept Aminatou developed with her BFF and \u201cCall Your Girlfriend\u201d co-host Ann Friedman. How are women building a new political culture based on the premise that \u201cI don\u2019t shine if you don\u2019t shine\u201d? How can we gain power by replacing competition with collaboration? And what does it take to truly invest in each other as friends?\n\n\nSunstorm is a project of the NDWA, in collaboration with Participant Media.\n \nSunstorm is executive produced by Alicia Garza, Ai-jen Poo, Kristina Mevs-Apgar, and Jess Morales Rocketto.
