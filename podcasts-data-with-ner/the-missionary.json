Folks back home and in Uganda praised her as a model missionary -- an example of the healing power of God\u2019s message. But a decade later she\u2019s accused of masquerading as a doctor and rumored to have killed hundreds of children in her unlicensed clinic. How did Renee Bach end up here? Is she a case of good intentions gone wrong...or a predator posing as a saint? Hosted and reported by journalists Rajiv Golla, Halima Gikandi and Malcolm Burnley. ",
