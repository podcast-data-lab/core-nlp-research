At three years of age, he started teaching himself to play piano by mimicking the boogie-woogie on the radio. From there, he set to figuring out how to compose his own music.\n\r\nRecently awarded the Pulitzer Prize, Threadgill talks with Helga about giving license to your imagination in order to create, the life energy that connects a performer to his creations, and pushing yourself to go beyond excellence to greatness.\n\r\n\u201cPeople have different names for the life force in them. But it\u2019s energy. The only thing that science seems to be able to tell us about energy is you can\u2019t destroy it. You can change it but you cannot destroy it. So wherever you house it, it\u2019s only being housed until it has to change.\u201d \u2013Henry Threadgill\n\r\nThis conversation contains explicit language that some listeners may find offensive.\n\r\nSubscribe to Helga on iTunes or wherever you get your podcasts, and follow Helga Davis on facebook.",
