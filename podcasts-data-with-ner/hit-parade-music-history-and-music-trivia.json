Here's an episode from another show we think you\u2019ll like. \nSlate's history podcast One Year introduces you to people and ideas that changed American history, one year at a time. The new season of One Year covers 1995, a year when homegrown terrorists attacked Oklahoma City and America went online. This episode is about \u201cMacarena\u201d\u2014yes, that \u201cMacarena,\u201d the song and the dance that became the defining left-field pop happening of the mid-\u201990s. This bilingual song by a pair of Spaniards, and a couple of Miami DJs they\u2019d never met, brought joy to millions, and it topped the charts for months, winding up Billboard\u2019s No. 1 hit of 1996\u2014over smashes by Mariah Carey, Boyz II Men and Celine Dion. And then, just as quickly, \u201cMacarena\u201d became a cultural pariah.\nIf you like this episode, follow One Year wherever you get podcasts.\nOne Year is produced by Josh Levin, Evan Chung, and Madeline Ducharme.

They also have quite a legacy: a blend of pop, dance and rap that now seems commonplace but was still relatively novel then. If you\u2019ve danced to Europop that fronts like hip-hop, you\u2019re living in a world Milli Vanilli helped create.\n \nChris Molanphy continues to break down the history of Milli Vanilli mastermind Frank Farian\u2019s musical career: from his burst of Billboard chart success, to the storied past of the Best New Artist Grammy award. From MTV News to Behind the Music, the Milli Vanilli story has been told and retold. But the Billboard chart feats achieved by Rob and Fab, and their accomplices, reveal just how addicted America was to their music\u2014and maybe, how they won that Grammy.\n\nHit Parade episodes are now split into two parts, released two weeks apart.

But it\u2019s possible no hitmaking mastermind\u2014not even Phil Spector\u2014has had a more specific pop sound than Jim Steinman. His songs have an unmistakable signature: pounding pianos, revving motorcycles, sometimes literal thunder. And power-vocalists singing passionate lyrics that don\u2019t always make sense but always sound like the fate of the world depends on this song.\nChris Molanphy tells the story of a fervent, headstrong songwriter who fused with a singer who called himself Meat Loaf, creating a blockbuster song cycle called Bat Out of Hell. Steinman then went on to spread his pomp-rock to other artists: Bonnie Tyler\u2019s \u201cTotal Eclipse of the Heart.\u201d Air Supply\u2019s \u201cMaking Love Out of Nothing at All.\u201d Celine Dion\u2019s \u201cIt\u2019s All Coming Back to Me Now.\u201d Every song sounded like a hallelujah chorus and a Broadway show\u2014even though Steinman\u2019s actual Broadway show was a notorious flop. But nothing keeps Jim Steinman down. Forever\u2019s gonna start tonight.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",

While the economic challenges of COVID-19 certainly haven\u2019t abated, Hit Parade has attracted enough new Plus members to allow us to take some episodes out from behind Slate\u2019s paywall starting in September.\n\nStarting next month, full-length Hit Parade episodes will debut in the middle of the month, not the end (our next full-length episode drops on Friday, September 18). If you are a Plus member, you\u2019ll hear the whole show all at once, the day it drops. If you are not a Plus member, you will receive the first half of the episode mid-month, with ads, and you\u2019ll have to wait a couple of weeks to hear the second half of the show, at month\u2019s end. Finally, Hit Parade\u2014\u201cThe Bridge\u201d episodes will remain Plus-only.\n\nIAgain, thanks to many of you who signed up for Slate Plus just to hear Hit Parade, and of course the thousands of longtime Plus members. We plan to keep giving you the bonus content you expect. And a hearty welcome back to non-Plus listeners\u2014we hope you\u2019ll consider joining Slate Plus in the future, but you can also support Hit Parade by spreading the word about our episodes. And to sign up for Slate Plus to support the show, head over to slate.com/hitparadeplus.\n\n\nIn this mini-episode of Hit Parade, host Chris Molanphy is joined by J.D. Ryznar, \u201cHollywood\u201d Steve Huey, and Dave Lyons, creators of the web series Yacht Rock and follow-up podcast Beyond Yacht Rock. Not only did they invent the very term that inspired the latest episode of Hit Parade, they have kept the fire alive by refining what the genre means.\n\nThe Yacht Rockers and Chris discuss the enduring legacy of the term they created\u2014from why the name stuck, to how it was perceived by the various artists whose music it defined. (Boz Scaggs is reportedly not happy.) They also reveal songs they\u2019d re-rate against their signature Yachtski scale, songs commonly tagged Yacht that are actually \u201cNyacht,\u201d and how they curate the boundaries of the genre. They even offer a Hit Parade\u2013exclusive announcement about what\u2019s next for their smooth creation.\n\nFinally, Chris quizzes a Slate Plus listener with some music trivia, gives her a chance to turn the tables on him, and previews next month\u2019s full-length episode.\n\nPodcast production by Asha Saluja. \n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Why did Carey\u2019s classic not chart in 1994, when it was released\u2014and why did it only start charting in the 2010s and seem to get more popular every year this decade?\nIn this special holiday edition of Hit Parade we answer all of these questions, and explain how virtually everything had to change about the music business for Mariah\u2019s Christmas chestnut to reach No. 1: from Billboard chart rules, to digital music technologies, to even the tragic passing of a fellow music diva. It all combined to give Carey her incredible 19th No. 1 on the Hot 100\u2014just one chart-topper away from the Beatles.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",

The challenge was following it up\u2014and Jackson and her producers, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, didn\u2019t make it easy on themselves.\nIn 1989, they produced an ambitious album with a portentous title: Janet Jackson\u2019s Rhythm Nation 1814. But what could have been Control, Part 2 instead was a visionary LP that reinvented the socially conscious album from the era of Marvin Gaye for the \u201990s, and envisioned what pop would eventually sound like in the 21st century. Rhythm Nation was a smash, generating more hits\u2014and bigger hits\u2014than any album in history. In fact, if Jackson and her label hadn\u2019t pulled their punches with one final radio single, she could have set an all-time Billboard chart record that would have overshadowed any of the Jackson family\u2019s historic achievements.\nPodcast production by Chris Berube.\nHostChris Molanphy\nFollow @cmolanphy on Twitter / https://www.twitter.com/cmolanphy \nLearn more about your ad choices.
